# dsh-deeptutor

**English** | [简体中文](https://github.com/TecFancy/dsh-deeptutor/blob/main/README.zh.md)

A **learning-assistant extension for DeepSeek Harness (dsh)**. It connects your
agent to a [HKUDS/DeepTutor](https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepTutor) tutoring
service, so a dsh session can explain topics in depth, quiz you, plan learning
paths, search your personal knowledge bases, and keep a study notebook — all
without leaving the harness.

Ask the agent *"teach me async/await"* and it can run a deep-solve, render the
answer as a self-contained HTML study page you can open in a browser, and
archive a summary into your notebook.

Migrated from the pi coding-agent extension
(`TecFancy/pi-extensions`, `extensions/deeptutor` + `skills/deeptutor`).

## What it adds

Three agent-facing tools that the model uses whenever you ask for learning help:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `deeptutor_run` | Runs one learning capability: `deep_solve` (in-depth explanation), `deep_question` (self-test questions), `deep_research`, `chat`, `mastery_path` (learning-path planning), `visualize` / `math_animator` (visualization). Can mount your knowledge bases (`kbs`) and tools (`rag`, `web_search`, `reason`, `code_execution`, …); returns a `session_id` so later turns continue the same context. |
| `deeptutor_kb` | Lists, searches, and inspects your personal knowledge bases (RAG) |
| `deeptutor_note` | Archives Markdown study notes (plans, summaries, wrong answers) into a server notebook |

The seven capabilities above are the fixed enum accepted by `deeptutor_run`.
The underlying DeepTutor CLI may expose more — enumerate the full command set
with `deeptutor --help` / `deeptutor <cmd> --help`. The `deeptutor` skill
instructs the agent to discover commands this way and, when the tool's enum
doesn't cover a capability, to drive the CLI directly (local binary or over
SSH).

## Example session

A typical flow when you ask your agent for learning help:

1. **Ask** — *"Explain C# generics covariance using my dotnet knowledge base, and generate a study page."*
2. The agent grounds the answer in your own material: `deeptutor_kb` (`action=search`, `kb=dotnet`).
3. It runs a deep-solve: `deeptutor_run` (`capability=deep_solve`, `kbs=[dotnet]`, `html=data/study/csharp-covariance.html`) — the answer comes back and a self-contained HTML page (plus the `.md` source) is written to disk.
4. It files a summary: `deeptutor_note` (`notebook=dotnet-learning`, `type=solve`).

Nothing here is a fixed script — the agent picks the tools and parameters based
on what you ask for.

A real recording of exactly this flow (deep-solve on the async/await state
machine, mounted on a `dotnet-csharp` knowledge base, rendered to an HTML
study page, then archived to a notebook):

## Requirements

- A working DeepSeek Harness (dsh) install. Bundle auto-registration via
  `dsh plugin add` is verified on dsh CLI 0.1.0-rc.6 + pnpm 8.15.6.
- A DeepTutor deployment, either:
  - **Local** — `deeptutor serve` running on this machine, or the `deeptutor`
    CLI on `PATH` (used as fallback);
  - **Remote** — DeepTutor on a server, reached through an auto-started SSH
    tunnel (with SSH CLI fallback).

## Install into a profile (bundle)

The package is published to npm as `dsh-deeptutor`. Recommended one-liner —
runs the bundled installer (`scripts/install-profile.mjs`, exposed as the
`dsh-deeptutor` binary), which wraps `dsh plugin add` and automatically
handles the pnpm workspace-root check described below:

```sh
pnpm dlx dsh-deeptutor --profile web
```

From a checkout of this repo, the same installer runs directly:

```sh
node scripts/install-profile.mjs --profile web
```

Or run the underlying command yourself — `dsh plugin add` forwards to pnpm
and then reconciles the profile's `dsh.profile.bundles` against the installed
state, so a `dsh.bundle`-declaring package like this one is registered
automatically:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-deeptutor -w
```

> **Pitfall — pnpm workspace-root check.** The dsh profile scaffold always
> writes a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`packages: ["."]`, `nodeLinker: hoisted`),
> which makes the profile directory itself a pnpm workspace root. On
> pnpm ≥ 8, `pnpm add` in a workspace root aborts with
> `ERR_PNPM_ADDING_TO_ROOT` unless the workspace-root flag is explicit, so
> the command above appends `-w`/`--workspace-root` (pnpm prints this error
> on stdout on Windows, which is why a plain `dsh plugin add` without the
> flag fails even though the output looks like a warning). Two ways to
> handle it:
>
> 1. Use the installer / keep `-w` in the command (recommended — the
>    installer tries the plain command first and adds `-w` automatically
>    only when the check trips).
> 2. Or allow the plain command permanently: add
>    `ignore-workspace-root-check: true` to
>    `~/.dsh/profiles/<name>/pnpm-workspace.yaml`, then
>    `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-deeptutor` works as written.

Verify the bundle is mounted, then restart dsh (the bundle list is resolved
at boot):

```sh
dsh --profile web --dump-config | grep dsh-deeptutor
```

If your dsh CLI does not auto-register the bundle (older versions, or you
installed the dependency manually), add it to the profile manifest
(`~/.dsh/profiles/<name>/package.json`) and run `dsh plugin --profile web
install`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": { "dsh-deeptutor": "^0.1.0" },
  "dsh": {
    "profile": { "bundles": ["@deepseek-ai/dsh-base", "@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app", "dsh-deeptutor"] }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, keep the manifest untouched and mount the bundle through a user
patch layer (the npm package still has to be installed first):

```yaml
# overlay.yml — insert the bundle row via a user patch layer
- insert:
    - id: dsh-deeptutor
      name: 'dsh-deeptutor'
```

```sh
dsh web --patch ./overlay.yml
```

The bundle manifest (`dsh.bundle.patch → cordis.patch.yml`) inserts the plugin
row; later patch layers can override or disable it by id.

## Skills

Two skills ship inside this package (`skills/deeptutor` and
`skills/html-doc`) and the bundled installer copies them to
`<DSH_HOME>/skills/<name>/` (auto-discovered by dsh) whenever it runs — so
`pnpm dlx dsh-deeptutor` installs the bundle **and** the skills in one shot:

- `deeptutor` — the agent-facing learning workflow (`~/.dsh/skills/deeptutor/SKILL.md`)
- `html-doc` — renders study answers to self-contained HTML pages
  (`~/.dsh/skills/html-doc/`); the bundle uses the same converter
  (`scripts/md-to-html.js`) when `deeptutor_run` gets an `html` path

Installing a newer package version overwrites skill files in place; files not
shipped by the package are never deleted.

The files under `skills/` are byte-identical copies of the same skills in
`TecFancy/pi-extensions` (single source of truth, agent-neutral). Sync them
after upstream edits with `node scripts/sync-skills.mjs ../pi-extensions`.

## Configuration (env vars, agent-agnostic)

```bash
# Remote deployment (DeepTutor on a server, reached through an SSH tunnel)
export DEEPTUTOR_SSH_HOST="tencent-cloud"           # SSH host alias (set = remote mode)
export DEEPTUTOR_API_BASE="http://127.0.0.1:8001"   # local tunnel address
export DEEPTUTOR_REMOTE_BIN="/home/ubuntu/my-deeptutor/.venv/bin/deeptutor"
export DEEPTUTOR_REMOTE_HOME="/home/ubuntu/my-deeptutor"

# Local deployment — leave DEEPTUTOR_SSH_HOST unset
# export DEEPTUTOR_API_BASE="http://127.0.0.1:8001"  # local serve port
# export DEEPTUTOR_LOCAL_BIN="deeptutor"             # local CLI path (default: deeptutor on PATH)
```

Restart dsh after changing env vars.

## How it works

The plugin auto-detects the deployment: if a DeepTutor API is reachable (local
`serve`, or a remote server via tunnel), learning turns run over HTTP/WebSocket;
otherwise it falls back to the CLI — the local `deeptutor` binary, or the remote
binary over SSH. Remote mode starts the SSH tunnel on demand and tears it down
when the plugin unloads.

## Develop against a checkout (no publish needed)

```sh
dsh web --patch /path/to/dsh-deeptutor/cordis.yml
```

## Build & publish

```sh
npm install
npm run build        # tsc → lib/ (relative .ts imports rewritten to .js)
npm run typecheck
npm test             # node:test + type stripping
npm pack             # inspect dsh-deeptutor-<version>.tgz
npm publish          # set a scope/registry of your choice first
```

Node ≥ 22.6 (type stripping) is needed to load the raw `src/*.ts` via
`--patch`; the published bundle ships compiled `lib/`, so installed profiles
run on plain Node ≥ 20 ESM.

## Layout

```
src/                 # TypeScript sources (dev loading, typecheck)
lib/                 # compiled ESM (published entry, from `npm run build`)
scripts/md-to-html.js  # zero-dependency Markdown → HTML converter
scripts/install-profile.mjs  # one-shot profile installer (exposed as the `dsh-deeptutor` binary)
skills/              # bundled skills: deeptutor/ + html-doc/ (installed to <DSH_HOME>/skills/)
cordis.yml           # dev overlay: insert src/index.ts by absolute path
cordis.patch.yml     # bundle patch: insert the package by name
```

`src/index.ts` registers the tools; `config.ts` holds env config;
`cli-exec.ts` local/SSH CLI execution; `http-api.ts` API probing + SSH tunnel;
`turn.ts` one learning turn (WebSocket / CLI event folding + formatting);
`html-render.ts` answer → self-contained HTML.
