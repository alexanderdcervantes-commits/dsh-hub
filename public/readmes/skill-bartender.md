Your agent already sees a catalog of skill names and descriptions — but it
**over-pours**: loads too many skills, loads the wrong ones, or misses the one
workflow skill that composes the task. **skill-bartender** is the meta-skill
that fixes the pour:

- 🪜 **Laziness ladder** — zero skills when plain tools suffice; one skill
  when one matches; workflow over hand-composed atomics; unsure → don't load.
- 🍷 **Routing table** — a user-editable task→skill map (`references/policy.md`)
  that overrides the defaults.
- 🔐 **Safe cellar** — a needed skill missing? Quarantine → SkillSpector scan
  → explicit human approval → install. Never auto-installs.
- 🧠 **Learn** — loaded-but-unused skills get logged and skipped next time.
- 🧪 **Taste test** — audit installed skills and rewrite weak descriptions
  into "when-to-use" sentences.

## 🤔 Why

Most agents treat the skill catalog as an all-you-can-eat buffet. `skill-bartender`
treats it as a bar with a taste test:

| | skill-bartender | Typical catalog behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Skills loaded per task | usually **one**; zero when plain tools suffice | whatever matches, however many |
| Workflow skills | ✅ preferred — never hand-assemble atomics | ❌ often missed or hand-composed |
| Unsure about a match | ❌ don't load (miss beats false pour) | ⚠️ loads "just in case" |
| Installing a missing skill | 🔐 quarantine → scan → **human approval** | ⚠️ downloads straight into the skills dir |
| Auto-install | ❌ never, by design | ⚠️ often silent |
| Learns from unused loads | ✅ logged, skipped next time | ❌ no memory |

**Why the "laziness ladder"?** A wrong skill body stays in conversation
history forever; a missed load only costs one tool round-trip. The best load
is the load never made (spirit: [ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail)).

## ✨ What you get

| Capability | What it does | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 🪜 Laziness ladder | Stop at the first rung that holds: 0 no skill → 1 one skill → 2 workflow skill → 3 unsure, don't load | all platforms |
| 🍷 Routing table | Task→skill map in `references/policy.md`; URL-keyed families (doc/drive/wiki/sheets/base/slides) routed by path pattern | all platforms |
| 🔐 Safe cellar | Missing skill: search → **quarantine dir** → SkillSpector scan → scripts shown to human (default deny) → explicit yes → install; source + commit hash + verdict recorded | DSH, Claude Code, Codex |
| 🧠 Learn | Unused loads logged and skipped for the same task type next time; chronic no-shows get offered for removal | DSH |
| 🧪 Taste test | On request: list installed skills, rewrite weak descriptions into trigger-phrase form (under the 500-char catalog cap) | on request |

## ⚡ Quick start

One file, three platforms:

```sh
# DeepSeek Harness
mkdir -p ~/.dsh/skills/skill-bartender
cp skills/skill-bartender/SKILL.md ~/.dsh/skills/skill-bartender/
cp -r skills/skill-bartender/references ~/.dsh/skills/skill-bartender/

# Claude Code
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/skill-bartender
cp skills/skill-bartender/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/skill-bartender/

# Codex
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills/skill-bartender
cp skills/skill-bartender/SKILL.md ~/.codex/skills/skill-bartender/
```

Or install as a DeepSeek Harness bundle:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:akqwpeter-prog/skill-bartender
```

Then say "skill-bartender" once, or paste the routing table into your
AGENTS.md for always-on routing. Full examples: [docs/EXAMPLES.md](docs/EXAMPLES.md).

## 🚀 Usage

Four ways to use it:

| Way | How | When |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Say the name** | In any session, just say "skill-bartender" | One-off or first-time setup |
| **B. Always-on routing** | Paste the routing table into AGENTS.md | Every task routes through the ladder |
| **C. Request a pour** | "Which skill fits this task?" | Choosing among skills |
| **D. Cellar audit** | "Audit my installed skills" | Taste test: weak descriptions get rewritten |

`skill-bartender` must itself be loaded once (user gesture or task match) —
it never self-triggers, and never pre-loads "just in case".

## 🔐 Security model (read this)

- Skills are **instructions**, and instructions can be adversarial (prompt
  injection). SkillSpector is a **filter, not a guarantee**.
- `scripts/` in any skill is **code** — never executed without human review.
- Human approval is mandatory for every install. **No silent installs, ever.**
- This skill scans itself clean: SkillSpector **0 findings** (score 0 / SAFE)
  — [docs/skillspector-report.json](docs/skillspector-report.json).
- Security policy: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## ❓ FAQ

**Does it auto-install missing skills?**
No. Every download goes to a quarantine dir, gets scanned with SkillSpector,
and is copied into the skills root only after explicit human approval. A
passing scan is a filter, not a guarantee — prompt injection survives static
scans, so scripts are shown to the human and default-deny.

**What if SkillSpector isn't installed?**
`uv tool install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/skillspector.git`, or run the
manual checklist in `references/policy.md`.

**Does it work with Claude Code and Codex?**
Yes — the same SKILL.md installs on all three platforms in ~15 seconds.

**How is this different from DshMarket / dsh-find-plugin / dsh-plugin-autoevo?**
They find, search, and auto-install plugins. skill-bartender adds the
**routing policy** (ladder + routing table) and the **quarantine-then-approve**
discipline. Use it *alongside* the ecosystem, not instead of it.

**How is it evaluated?**
The routing policy ships with a gold-task suite: [docs/eval.md](docs/eval.md).

## 🎁 Examples

- [docs/EXAMPLES.md](docs/EXAMPLES.md) — real routing cases, cellar installs, audits.
- [docs/ROUTING-GUIDE.md](docs/ROUTING-GUIDE.md) — how to write your own task→skill rules.
- [docs/eval.md](docs/eval.md) — gold-task suite for the routing policy.
