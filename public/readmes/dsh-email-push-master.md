# dsh-email-push-master

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

**Email reminders from your DSH agent when you're away from the computer.**

You start a long-running goal in [DSH](https://github.com/deepseek-ai) (or any AI coding agent), then walk away. When the agent finishes, gets blocked, or needs your decision, it sends an email to your phone mailbox — you see it and come back. One-way ping, no remote control.

## Origin & what changed

This is a fork of [dsh-notify-skill](https://github.com/PAKIKNOWLEDGE/dsh-notify-skill) (MIT, open source), hardened for stability:

- removed the `535` retry loop (it amplified account risk-control lockout) and fixed a `subject`/`text` crash;
- added connect/idle timeouts, a `--check` self-test, structured error classification, and full message headers.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Design: bundle a sender, avoid hand-written fallbacks

The skill ships **one zero-dependency implementation** — `sender.mjs` (only Node built-ins `tls`/`net`), so the agent sends mail deterministically in every normal DSH session (DSH runs on Node). The sender has connect/idle timeouts, structured error classification (`535`/`550`/network), **never retries `535`** (retries amplify risk-control lockout), and full message headers. The `SKILL.md` still carries the full contract:

- **when** to notify (goal done / blocked / before asking you a decision / long-task milestone),
- **what** to write (specific, in your language, short),
- the **config contract** (`config.json`: sender, SMTP authorization code, recipient; auto-inferred hosts for QQ/163 mail),
- how to **guide the user** through getting an SMTP authorization code when the config is missing,
- failure handling and security rules.

If Node is genuinely unavailable (rare), the agent should stop and tell the user rather than hand-writing SMTP; hand-written SMTP is the main source of intermittent `535` auth failures.

## How it works

| Moment | Suggested marker |
|---|---|
| Goal completed | `done` |
| Goal blocked / stuck | `block` |
| About to ask the user a decision | `question` |
| Long task milestone | `info` |

The agent MUST send via the bundled sender (do not hand-write SMTP):

```bash
node sender.mjs "subject" "body"          # reads config.json next to it and sends
node sender.mjs --check                   # verify config + SMTP auth only, no email
```

> Knowledge note (Windows): .NET `SmtpClient` has a known hang on implicit-TLS port 465 — the bundled sender uses `node:tls` instead, which has no such issue.

## Install (DSH)

**Plugin install (recommended)** — the skill ships as a DSH plugin and registers on `ctx.skills`:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-email-push-master
```

Or from GitHub: `dsh plugin --profile web add github:JamesYasR/dsh-email-push-master`. Restart `dsh web` once after installing, then the skill appears in the session skill catalog.

**Manual install (no plugin)** — DSH also discovers skills from `<dshHome>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (default `~/.dsh/skills`), hot-reloaded by a filesystem watcher:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JamesYasR/dsh-email-push-master.git "$HOME/.dsh/skills/notify"
```

Or copy the folder manually to `~/.dsh/skills/notify/`. New sessions pick it up immediately.

## Setup (one-time, ~5 minutes)

The agent will also walk you through this if you just ask it to use the skill.

1. Get an SMTP **authorization code** (not your login password):
   - **QQ Mail**: web QQ Mail → 设置 → 账户 → enable "POP3/SMTP 服务" → generate a 16-char 授权码
   - **163 Mail**: web 163 Mail → 设置 → POP3/SMTP/IMAP/SMTP → enable → create 授权码
2. Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and fill it in:
   ```json
   {
     "email": {
       "smtpHost": "",
       "smtpPort": 465,
       "useSsl": true,
       "from": "your-address@qq.com",
       "authCode": "16-char authorization code",
       "to": "recipient@example.com"
     }
   }
   ```
   `smtpHost` may be left empty — it is inferred (`@qq.com` → `smtp.qq.com`, `@163.com` → `smtp.163.com`, port 465 SSL).
3. Test: ask your agent to send a test notification (it will use the bundled sender).

## Other agents (Claude Code, Codex, ...)

No compatibility work needed — modern agents are smart. Point them at `SKILL.md` and the config contract; they should use the bundled sender rather than re-implementing SMTP.

## Security

- `config.json` (contains your SMTP authorization code) and `notify.log` are **gitignored** — never force-commit them. A leaked authorization code lets anyone send mail as your mailbox.
- The skill instructs agents to never print or commit the authorization code.

## Quickstart

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:JamesYasR/dsh-email-push-master
```

Restart `dsh web`, then open **Settings → Plugins → 邮件推送** to configure provider / server / sender / auth code / recipient. Or run `node sender.mjs --check` for an auth self-test.
