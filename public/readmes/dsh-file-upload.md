[![Awesome DSH Plugin](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/badge.svg)](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com)

**One upload button + drag-and-drop files straight into the conversation** — a plugin for DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) web.

*Unofficial project: independently developed and maintained by a community member, not an official DeepSeek product.*

## Screenshot

![dsh-file-upload in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a903067276-rgb/dsh-file-upload/c4e41b09aa63434fe0ec764fe60ac15197df06b5/assets/screenshot.png)

The upload icon button in the composer tool row (official DSH design tokens, follows dark/light theme); the picked file's path (blurred in the screenshot) is inserted into the input box automatically, ready to send.

## Features

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| Click upload icon | System file picker (multi-select) → save → path into the input box |
| Drag a file into the window | Images & any file type are taken over (no "unsupported" toast) → save → path into the input box |
| Send the message | The model / vision tool reads the file by absolute path |
| Switch sessions | Button follows the current session; files land in that session's project `uploads/` |

- Single-file limit: 25 MB (frontend) / 30 MB (backend)
- Filenames keep Chinese/space characters; a timestamp prefix avoids collisions
- Button shows busy state while uploading; failures surface as Chinese notices

## Install

Official bundle install (one line):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:a903067276-rgb/dsh-file-upload#main"
```

Restart `dsh web` (bundle layers are composed at startup). Requires pnpm on PATH (`dsh plugin` forwards to pnpm).

Manual mount (fallback): see [docs/install.md](docs/install.md) — symlink into `~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules/` plus a **single entry** in `~/.dsh/cordis.patch.yml` (a double entry makes the plugin apply twice and crash on duplicate route registration), then restart.

## Usage

1. Click the upload icon and pick files (multi-select), or drag files anywhere into the window.
2. The file is saved to the current project's `uploads/` directory; the input box gets `[上传文件] <absolute path>` lines — e.g. `[上传文件] /path/to/uploads/xxx.png` — and your existing draft text is kept.
3. Press send; the model — or any attached vision tool — reads the file by path.

## Platform support

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| macOS | ✅ fully tested (development environment) |
| Linux | ✅ expected to work (pure Node implementation), untested |
| Windows | ⚠️ expected to work (pure Node implementation, Windows-safe filename sanitization, platform separator paths), untested |

## Requirements

- DSH web (run with `dsh web`)
- No extra shell needed: the host half is pure Node (`node:fs`), no system commands required on any platform.

## How it works

- **Host** (`lib/index.js`): one route `POST /api/file-upload/save` — validates the session and size, then writes the base64 payload to `<session cwd>/uploads/` with **pure Node** (`node:fs`, no system command dependency, cross-platform); the returned path is built via `node:path` and follows the platform separator.
- **Client** (`lib/client.js`): registers the upload icon button in the `conversation.input.left` seat (visually distinct from the default "+" command button); a capture-phase document listener takes over file drags before the official InputBar's bubble-phase listener (which would reject images); `FileReader` reads base64, uploads it, then the path text is appended to the input draft (`inputActions.setDraft`).
- **Error boundary**: a render crash degrades to a small "⚠ upload component error" chip instead of unmounting the whole composer.

## Notes

- The `uploads/` directory only grows; it is **never cleaned automatically** (we don't delete your files) — remove files manually when needed.
- After modifying the plugin, restart `dsh web` for changes to take effect (client-side edits apply on a page refresh; host edits need a restart).

## Why this plugin exists

DSH natively rejects dragged-in images when the current model doesn't support them (official toast: "the current model does not support images"). This plugin saves the file to disk first and puts a **path text** into the conversation instead — a plain-text message that passes the model's image check and works with any model or vision plugin.

**Vision-plugin agnostic**: the message only carries a local absolute path (plain text), so it works with dsh-vision's `view_image`, any other model/tool that can read local paths, or no vision at all. It bypasses DSH's native image rejection because no image block is ever submitted.
