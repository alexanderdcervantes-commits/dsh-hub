# @7dgroup/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer

**Author: 7DGroup**

A professional, template-driven code review skill plugin for DeepSeek Harness (DSH), developed by the 7DGroup team for AI-assisted code review in any dsh session. Built on TypeScript + Cordis, it installs as a composable bundle and registers the `7d-code-reviewer` skill with `ctx.skills`: a five-step review flow, critical/medium/minor severity grading, four-dimension scoring, and dual text + HTML report output. Zero core changes — install to enable, remove the bundle row to uninstall.

**Core Capabilities**:

- **Template-driven mode** — separation of concerns: `SKILL.md` decides what to review and how severe it is, `templates/` only presents. The HTML report template stays pure placeholders; all placeholders must be filled, and every dynamic value is HTML-escaped.
- **Five-step review flow** — accept the task → quick scan → line-by-line review (loading `references/` on demand) → severity grading → report generation.
- **Three-level severity grading** — 🔴 critical (must fix) / 🟡 medium (should fix) / 🟢 minor (optional polish).
- **Four-dimension scoring** — code quality / security / performance / maintainability, each on a 1–10 scale, plus an overall score and an auto-generated summary.
- **Dual output** — a text summary for quick reading, plus a full HTML report saved as `code-review-report-{timestamp}.html`.
- **Built-in knowledge base** — coding standards, security checklist (SQL injection, XSS, authentication/authorization, sensitive-data leaks) and worked review examples, loaded on demand instead of bloating the prompt.
- **Zero core changes** — pure composable bundle; no patches to the DSH core, safe to install and remove.

**Use Cases**:

- Code review before commit / merge request
- Security audit of existing code
- Quality assessment before refactoring
- Enforcing team coding standards
- Any code quality question inside a dsh conversation

## ✅ Features

- ✅ Five-step template-driven review flow

## 🚀 Quick Start

Prerequisites: `dsh` CLI, Node `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`, pnpm 10+.

### Install from within a dsh session (recommended)

The most direct way — just ask the agent in any dsh conversation, and it runs the install for you. Use the GitHub spec — the npm name `@7dgroup/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer` only works after the package is published:

> 安装插件 github:7dgroup-ai/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer

(Or in English: "Install the plugin github:7dgroup-ai/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer" — the agent executes the equivalent `dsh plugin` command through its session shell.)

For a git install the agent will hit the same pnpm `allowBuilds` gate and print the exact key to add to the profile's pnpm settings file (`~/.dsh/profiles/<name>/pnpm-workspace.yaml`); after you add it, ask the agent to retry and the skill is enabled.

### Install directly in dsh (CLI)

Run one command directly in dsh — the `github:` shorthand is the fastest way:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add github:7dgroup-ai/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer
```

`<name>` is the profile you boot with `dsh --profile <name>` — see [What is a dsh profile?](#what-is-a-dsh-profile) below for how profiles work, how to pick a name and where the profile files live.

The full URL form is equivalent:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add git+https://github.com/7dgroup-ai/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer.git
```

`dsh plugin` appends the bundle to the profile's `dsh.profile.bundles`, and the bundle's own patch layer mounts the `skill-7d-code-reviewer` row over the base composition.

pnpm blocks a git dependency's build scripts until explicitly allowed, so the first `add` fails. Copy the exact package key pnpm printed into the profile's pnpm settings file — `~/.dsh/profiles/<name>/pnpm-workspace.yaml` — then re-run:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  '@7dgroup/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer@git+https://github.com/7dgroup-ai/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer.git#<sha>': true
```

(With the `github:` shorthand the key reads `@7dgroup/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer@github:7dgroup-ai/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer#<sha>` — always copy the exact key pnpm prints.)

Allowing a build means letting that package's code run on your machine at install time, outside any agent sandbox. Prefer pinning a commit (`...#<sha>`) so later pushes cannot silently change what runs.

### What is a dsh profile?

Every dsh run boots a **profile** — a named environment whose configuration lives under the harness home in `~/.dsh/profiles/<name>` (or `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<name>` if the `DSH_HOME` env var is set). A profile directory holds:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `package.json` | Profile manifest: `dsh.profile.bundles` lists the ordered plugin bundles to mount; `dependencies` holds out-of-tree plugins |
| `cordis.patch.yml` | Your own patch layer, applied after every bundle layer |
| `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | pnpm settings for the profile; the `allowBuilds` key goes here |
| `node_modules` | pnpm-managed plugin dependencies |

There is **no default profile** — `dsh --profile <name>` is required on every run (`dsh web` is a shorthand for `dsh --profile web`). The shipped `web` and `headless` profiles auto-initialize on first boot; any other name is created automatically the first time you run a `dsh plugin --profile <name> ...` command, which reports where it was created:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile tui add github:7dgroup-ai/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer
# dsh: initialized profile tui at ~/.dsh/profiles/tui
```

To see which profiles already exist, list `~/.dsh/profiles/` — each subdirectory is one profile name. A custom name must be created this way before it can boot: `dsh --profile <name>` on an unknown custom name fails with the hint `create it with 'dsh plugin --profile <name> add <package>'`.

### Install from tarball (no build approval)

A prebuilt tarball is committed at the repository root — download it and install directly:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add ./7dgroup-dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer-0.1.0-rc.5.tgz
```

Or once published on npm:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add @7dgroup/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer
```

Both forms ship prebuilt code and need no `allowBuilds` allowance.

### Recommended setup — install into the `web` profile

Most sessions boot the default `web` profile (`dsh web` is a shorthand for `dsh --profile web`), so the recommended path is to install the skill there — no new profile needed:

**Step 0 — pnpm on PATH.** `dsh plugin` forwards to pnpm in the profile directory, so pnpm must be installed and on PATH:

```sh
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate   # or: npm install -g pnpm@10
```

**Step 1 — install via the `github:` shorthand.** A git install runs the package's `prepare` build, which pnpm blocks until explicitly allowed — so the first `add` fails:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:7dgroup-ai/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer
```

Copy the exact key pnpm prints into `~/.dsh/profiles/web/pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  '@7dgroup/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer@github:7dgroup-ai/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer#<sha>': true
```

then re-run the same command. Prefer **pinning a commit** — append `#<sha>` to the spec (`github:7dgroup-ai/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer#<sha>`) so later pushes cannot silently change what runs.

**Prefer no build approval?** Install the prebuilt tarball instead — it ships ready-to-run code and never hits the `allowBuilds` gate:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add ./7dgroup-dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer-0.1.0-rc.5.tgz
```

**After install.** The profile manifest `~/.dsh/profiles/web/package.json` gains the dependency and the bundle row:

```json
{
  "name": "dsh-profile-web",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@7dgroup/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer": "<version>"
  },
  "dsh": {
    "profile": {
      "bundles": [
        "@deepseek-ai/dsh-base",
        "@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app",
        "@7dgroup/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Nothing else needs editing — `cordis.patch.yml` stays `[]`, because the bundle's own patch layer mounts the `skill-7d-code-reviewer` row automatically. Verify the mount with `dsh --profile web --dump-config`, restart the session (bundle changes apply on the next boot), then run `/7d-code-reviewer`.

**Using a different profile?** Replace `web` with the name you boot (`dsh --profile <name>`); the skill only activates in the profile it is installed into.

### Build and test

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build   # tsdown; also runs as the `prepare` hook on git installs
pnpm test    # vitest
```

## 💡 Usage

The skill activates whenever you ask for a code review — either with the slash command or in natural language:

> /7d-code-reviewer Review this module: ...

The five-step review flow:

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| 1. Accept the task | Take the submitted code or file paths; determine the language and business context |
| 2. Quick scan | Classify the change (new feature / bugfix / refactor); locate the core files and key logic |
| 3. Line-by-line review | Load the matching references on demand; check naming, security, performance and error handling |
| 4. Severity grading | 🔴 critical — must fix · 🟡 medium — should fix · 🟢 minor — optional improvement |
| 5. Report generation | Fill the placeholder HTML template; output the text summary plus `code-review-report-{timestamp}.html` |

### Output example (text summary)

```

The full HTML report is saved to `code-review-report-{timestamp}.html` and the file path is reported back to you.

## 📊 Grading & Scoring Standards

Severity levels:

| Level | Marker | Definition | Handling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Critical | 🔴 | security vulnerability, crash risk | must fix |
| Medium | 🟡 | performance hazard, logic flaw | should fix |
| Minor | 🟢 | naming, comments | optional improvement |

Dimension scoring (each on a 1–10 scale):

| Dimension | Excellent (8–10) | Good (6–7) | Needs work (4–5) | Poor (1–3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Code quality | clear naming, clean structure, no duplication | mostly compliant, minor issues | confusing naming or high complexity | violates coding standards |
| Security | no risk, parameterized queries, full validation | basically safe, small flaws | security hazards | severe vulnerabilities |
| Performance | efficient algorithms, caching, no N+1 | acceptable | obvious problems | severe defects |
| Maintainability | documented, modular, high test coverage | maintainable | missing comments/tests | hard to maintain |

Overall score bands: 9–10 excellent · 7–8 good · 5–6 fair · 3–4 poor · 1–2 very poor (fix immediately).

## 📈 HTML Report

- **Score circle** — overall score (1–10) with an auto-generated summary
- **Issue statistics bar** — critical / medium / minor counts and good points
- **Dimension score cards** — code quality / security / performance / maintainability
- **Issues grouped by severity** — location, description and fix suggestion (with code sample)
- **Good points & improvement suggestions** sections
- Pure-placeholder template — all placeholders must be filled; every dynamic value is HTML-escaped per `scripts/html-report-generation.md`
- Empty sections follow the no-content rule (e.g. "🎉 未发现严重问题！")

## ⚠️ Notes

1. The provider contributes one fixed skill; no runtime customization.
2. Report quality depends on the model following the placeholder-filling and HTML-escaping rules; nothing validates the generated report.
3. The prepared build ships no type declarations; the dsh Loader loads the runtime entry only.
4. The build is transpile-only (`dts: false`) with no lint or typecheck scripts — type errors surface in the editor/IDE.
5. Commit messages in this repository follow the Simplified Chinese convention: `【类型】简短描述` (nine fixed type tags).

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why does the first `dsh plugin add` fail?**
A: pnpm refuses to run build scripts of git dependencies until explicitly allowed. Copy the exact package key pnpm printed into the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` → `allowBuilds`, then re-run.

**Q: How do I pin a specific commit?**
A: Append `#<sha>` to the spec, e.g. `git+https://github.com/7dgroup-ai/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer.git#<sha>` — later pushes cannot silently change what runs.

**Q: How do I uninstall?**
A: Run `dsh plugin --profile <name> remove @7dgroup/dsh-skill-7d-code-reviewer` (pnpm removes the dependency and the bundle row is reconciled away), or edit the profile's `package.json` and remove the row from `dsh.profile.bundles`. No core patches are left behind.

**Q: Can I install without approving builds?**
A: Yes — use the prebuilt tarball (committed at the repository root) or the npm package (once published); neither needs `allowBuilds`.

**Q: Which profile should I install into?**
A: The one you boot — `dsh --profile <name>` is required on every run, and the skill only activates in the profile it is installed into. Most sessions boot `web` (`dsh web`), so `dsh plugin --profile web add ...` is the typical command.

**Q: `dsh plugin` fails with "pnpm not found"?**
A: `dsh plugin` forwards to pnpm in the profile directory — install pnpm and put it on PATH (`corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate` or `npm install -g pnpm@10`), then re-run.
