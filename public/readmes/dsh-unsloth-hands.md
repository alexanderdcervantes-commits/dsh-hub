</div>

A third-party **tool plugin** for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) that lets the **online model** (your main conversation model) hand repetitive, token-cheap labor to a **local Unsloth Desktop** (Unsloth Studio) server — plain text work *and* vision work (image analysis / OCR / comparison).

The main model stays where your deployment puts it. When it decides a job is better done locally, it calls:

- **`unsloth_run`** — run one prompt on the local text model (batch rewrites, name translations, string munging, short summarization, extraction).
- **`unsloth_vision`** — send images to the local multimodal model (OCR, image analysis, multi-image comparison) with structured report templates.

The plugin is a **pure client**: it only connects to the Unsloth Desktop **you are already running**. Model selection, downloading, quantization and context settings all happen in the Unsloth app itself — the plugin never starts, owns, or stops any process, and never kills anything.

---

## ✨ What it does

- **Two model-facing tools** registered on the harness tool registry (`ctx.tools`), following the official `dsh-tools` contract (`defineTool`, canonical JSON values, pure render/presenters, `exec.signal` forwarding).
- **Authenticated wire calls**: every request carries `Authorization: Bearer sk-unsloth-…`. The key comes from the `apiKey` config or the `UNSLOTH_API_KEY` environment variable (create it in Unsloth Settings → API).
- **Friendly failure modes**: before each call the plugin probes `/v1/models`; if Unsloth Desktop is not running you get a clear, actionable error instead of a generic network failure. A wrong/missing key surfaces as `AUTH` with a hint.
- **Text + vision wire support**: non-streaming OpenAI-compatible chat-completions; images sent as the standard multimodal `content` array.
- **Three image sources** for the vision tool: local file paths, `data:`/`http(s):` URLs, or the images attached to the current conversation (read through the harness attachment service).
- **Structured vision prompts** — machine-verifiable report contracts: `analyze` (8-section report), `ocr` (character-exact), `compare` (multi-image, 5-section) — plus a fidelity rule for the online model (relay verbatim, never invent, preserve uncertainty).
- **Live config**: a `llm-unsloth:` section in the harness user-settings document overrides the plugin config without a restart.
- **Safe by construction**: nothing is ever spawned or killed — the plugin only talks HTTP to your Unsloth Desktop.

## 🚫 What it does NOT do

- Does **not** replace the harness LLM provider — the online model stays the main model; the local model is only reached through the two tools.
- Does **not** launch, configure, or stop Unsloth — **you** run Unsloth Desktop and load the model you want (quantization, context size, GPU settings) in its UI.
- Does **not** modify any DeepSeek Harness or Unsloth file; it is a pure add-on plugin.
- Does **not** bundle or host GGUF model files — Unsloth downloads and caches them for you.
- Does **not** stream responses (tool calls get the full answer in one round trip).

## 📋 Requirements

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | ≥ 20 |
| DeepSeek Harness | installed (`npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web` or a source checkout), `0.1.0-rc` series |
| Unsloth Desktop | running, with a model loaded and an API key created (Settings → API) |
| Model | any GGUF/safetensors model loaded in Unsloth; vision needs a multimodal model (e.g. Qwen3-VL / Gemma vision GGUFs) |

## 📦 Install

The package is a standard harness **bundle** (declares `dsh.bundle` with its `cordis.patch.yml`), so the official install path works:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add dsh-unsloth-hands        # from npm registry
dsh plugin --profile <name> add github:MicroHEROX/dsh-unsloth-hands   # straight from GitHub
```

It can also be installed as a plain npm dependency in your harness project (the directory whose `cordis.yml` / `cordis.patch.yml` composes your deployment), then add the plugin row yourself:

```sh
npm install dsh-unsloth-hands
```

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: unsloth-tool
      name: 'dsh-unsloth-hands'
```

From a source checkout of the harness, you can point the plugin row directly at a clone of this repo:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: unsloth-tool
      name: '../dsh-unsloth-hands'
```

> **Installing from GitHub?** pnpm may refuse to run the package's `prepare` build script until you allowlist it (exact package key printed by pnpm) in your profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:
> ```yaml
> allowBuilds:
>   dsh-unsloth-hands: true
> ```
> Then re-run the `add`. Installing from the npm registry needs no such step.

## ⚙️ Configure

1. Start **Unsloth Desktop**, load the model you want (the model hub downloads GGUFs; the loaded model is the one the tools reach).
2. Create an API key: **avatar → Settings → API → Create**, copy the `sk-unsloth-…` value (it is only shown once).
3. Add the plugin row to your profile `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: unsloth-tool
      name: 'dsh-unsloth-hands'
      config:
        baseURL: 'http://127.0.0.1:8888'              # Unsloth's default port
        apiKey: 'sk-unsloth-xxxx...'                   # from Unsloth Settings → API
```

That's it. The plugin connects to whatever model is currently loaded — no model names, no config files, no launch flags. Alternatively set `UNSLOTH_API_KEY` in your environment instead of `apiKey`.

> Installed via `dsh plugin add`? The bundle already inserts the `unsloth-tool` row — just override its config in your profile's `cordis.patch.yml` (the harness override form, no `name` needed):
> ```yaml
> - id: unsloth-tool
>   config:
>     apiKey: 'sk-unsloth-xxxx...'
> ```

## 🛠 Using the tools

### `unsloth_run` — text

| param | type | required | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `prompt` | string | yes | instruction/text sent as a user message |
| `system` | string | no | optional system instructions |
| `temperature` | number | no | sampling temperature (0–2) |
| `max_tokens` | integer | no | output cap (default `maxTokens`) |
| `stop` | string[] | no | stop sequences |

Returns `{ text, reasoning?, model, usage, elapsedMs }`.

### `unsloth_vision` — images / OCR

| param | type | required | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | `analyze`/`ocr`/`compare` | no | built-in prompt template (default `analyze`) |
| `prompt` | string | no | custom instruction (overrides the template) |
| `image_paths` | string[] | no | local images (png/jpg/jpeg/webp/gif/bmp, ≤20 MB each) |
| `image_urls` | string[] | no | `data:image/...` or `http(s)://` URLs |
| `temperature` | number | no | sampling temperature (lower for OCR, ~0.2) |
| `max_tokens` | integer | no | output cap |
| `stop` | string[] | no | stop sequences |

Image sources resolve in order: explicit `image_paths` + `image_urls` → the most recent image(s) attached to the conversation → clear error. `compare` sends 2–4 images in ONE request for joint reasoning.

Returns `{ text, reasoning?, model, images, usage, elapsedMs }`.

> Vision requires the model **currently loaded in Unsloth** to be multimodal. Unsloth serves one loaded model at a time — switch to a vision model in the app before calling `unsloth_vision`.

## ❓ FAQ

**My main model is text-only — how do images get in?**

DeepSeek's flagship chat models (and most other routes) are text-only: the harness refuses to send image messages to them (the adapter rejects them with `UNSUPPORTED_CONTENT`), so you cannot attach an image to the conversation. That is exactly the case `unsloth_vision` is built for — **no harness upload is involved**:

1. When you paste/drop an image in a text-only model's composer, the harness (like OpenCode and Pi) lands it as a **temporary file path in your message** instead of pixels.
2. The model sees that path, calls `unsloth_vision` with `image_paths: ["<that path>"]` (or an `image_urls` entry), and the local vision model reads the file directly.
3. You can also just tell the model a path to any image on disk.

For a main model that DOES support images, the conversation-attachment source also works automatically.

**My requests get `401 Unauthorized`?**

Unsloth requires a valid key on every request. Create one in **Settings → API** (revoked keys fail with 401) and put it in `apiKey` or `UNSLOTH_API_KEY`. The health probe treats a 401 as "server is running" — the error surfaces from the tool call itself with an actionable message.

## 🗺 Roadmap

**Possible / planned directions:**

- More vision modes and prompt templates (document layouts, table extraction).
- Reading the currently loaded model from `/v1/models` to fill the wire `model` field automatically.
- Publishing to the npm registry and the `dsh-plugin` topic.
- Batch jobs: drive many local calls from one agent turn.

**Deliberately NOT planned:**

- Launching or managing the Unsloth process — the plugin stays a pure client; you own the app.
- Becoming an LLM provider adapter — the plugin stays a tool; the online model stays the main model.
- Streaming responses — tool calls get the full answer in one round trip (simpler and sufficient).
- Bundling model files or modifying DeepSeek Harness / Unsloth itself.

## 🗑 Uninstall

1. **Remove the plugin row** from your profile `cordis.patch.yml` (or `cordis.yml`):
   ```yaml
   # delete this block
   - insert:
       - id: unsloth-tool
         name: 'dsh-unsloth-hands'
   ```
   Installed via `dsh plugin`? `dsh plugin --profile <name> remove dsh-unsloth-hands` removes both the dependency and its bundle layer.
2. **Restart the harness** (or let HMR reload if you edit the config live). The two tools (`unsloth_run`, `unsloth_vision`) are unregistered automatically — the online model no longer sees them.
3. **No residue**: the plugin never spawned anything, so there is nothing to stop; your Unsloth Desktop keeps running untouched. Installed via npm? `npm uninstall dsh-unsloth-hands`.
