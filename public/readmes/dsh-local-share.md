Local, privacy-first Markdown and self-contained HTML sharing for
[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) Sessions.
DSH Local Share is an independent community plugin.

Turn a complete DSH Session into a reviewable document without uploading the
conversation. DSH Local Share adds a **Share** action to the Web Session header,
builds a local preview, and lets you copy the source or download a file.

- Markdown or one script-free, self-contained HTML file
- Safe GFM rendering for assistant headings, lists, tables, and code
- Best-effort redaction enabled on every dialog opening
- Stable, flicker-free preview before copy or download
- Tool names, bounded arguments, and outcomes are opt-in
- Tool result bodies and model reasoning are never exported
- No cloud service, account, public-link backend, or outbound request
- Zero model-visible text and zero model-token overhead

Assistant Markdown is rendered into a calm, readable document while the human
prompt remains literal. This privacy-safe product mockup uses fictional data:

## Quick start

DSH is currently a developer preview. Install the exact release into the Web
profile, then start DSH:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:ChuanTianML/dsh-local-share#v0.3.0
dsh --profile web
```

Open a non-empty Session and select **Share** in its header. The safe defaults
are Markdown, tool calls excluded, and redaction enabled.

To remove the plugin:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-local-share
```

### Upgrading from DSH Share 0.1.0

Version 0.2.0 and later use a distinct package and plugin id to avoid colliding with an
unrelated community plugin named `dsh-share`:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-share
dsh plugin --profile web add github:ChuanTianML/dsh-local-share#v0.3.0
```

## See the privacy flow

The dialog starts safe. If redaction is turned off, copy and download stay
locked until the user gives a fresh acknowledgement; reopening the dialog
restores the safe defaults.

The recording uses the real Web application and an isolated DSH profile. The
example Session contains benign demonstration text only.

## Install with a Coding Agent

Yes. Installation, configuration, and verification use inspectable CLI commands
and one YAML profile patch. Paste this request into a Coding Agent that has
terminal access to the machine where DSH is installed:

```text
Install DSH Local Share v0.3.0 into my DeepSeek Harness Web profile.

1. Detect the active DSH_HOME and dsh version. Do not modify another profile.
2. Inspect the repository package.json lifecycle scripts before installation.
3. Install github:ChuanTianML/dsh-local-share#v0.3.0 into profile web.
4. Preserve unrelated entries in profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml. Configure the
   dsh-local-share entry with maxEvents 20000, maxOutputChars 2000000, and
   maxToolArgumentChars 12000.
5. Run dsh --profile web --dump-config and prove those values are active.
6. Start the Web profile, open a non-empty Session, and verify that Share opens
   with Markdown selected, tool calls excluded, and redaction enabled.
7. Report every command run and any file changed. Never upload an exported
   Session or disable redaction without asking me first.
```

For an evaluation that must not touch an existing setup, tell the Agent to use
a fresh temporary `DSH_HOME` for steps 1–6.

## Host configuration

The defaults work for ordinary Sessions. For an explicit, auditable setup, add
the complete config object to `$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`
(`~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml` when `DSH_HOME` is unset):

```yaml
- id: dsh-local-share
  config:
    maxEvents: 20000
    maxOutputChars: 2000000
    maxToolArgumentChars: 12000
```

Harness profile patches replace the target `config` object rather than deeply
merging individual fields, so writing all three limits is the clearest option.
Confirm the final composition without starting the Web server:

```sh
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `maxEvents` | `20000` | Maximum raw Session events accepted |
| `maxOutputChars` | `2000000` | Maximum file or preview characters |
| `maxToolArgumentChars` | `12000` | Maximum retained arguments per enabled tool call |

Session and output overflows fail visibly. Tool arguments alone may be
truncated, with a warning in the preview. Invalid values fail when the plugin
loads.

## Privacy behavior

The default document contains only direct human prompts and visible assistant
text in log order.

| Content | Default | Optional |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Human prompts | Included | — |
| Visible assistant text | Included | — |
| Tool names, bounded arguments, outcomes | Excluded | Enable “Include tool calls” |
| Tool result bodies | Excluded | Never included |
| Reasoning / thinking | Excluded | Never included |
| System prompts and request configuration | Excluded | Never included |
| Plugin-injected user-role context | Excluded | Never included |
| Attachment bytes and Session metadata | Excluded | Never included |

Redaction covers common credentials, authorization headers, secret-bearing
environment assignments, email addresses, and absolute local paths. It is
heuristic, not a guarantee. Always review the preview. If redaction is disabled,
copy and download remain locked until a fresh risk acknowledgement is checked.

The preview runs in a sandboxed `srcdoc` iframe. Generated HTML has no scripts or
external resources and carries a restrictive Content Security Policy. Visible
assistant text is rendered as safe GFM; human prompts remain literal so the
shared document preserves what the user actually entered.

## Why this plugin instead of the Session log ZIP?

The official Session log export is the right lossless ZIP for diagnosis and
migration. DSH Local Share produces a smaller, human-readable document for code
review, issue reports, handoffs, and knowledge sharing. It intentionally omits
data that a replay or forensic workflow would need.

## Development

The verified Harness revision is
`47f943859bef60e4160492346772ded9b24f765a`. Keep the checkout isolated under
`.sandbox/harness`:

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm install
git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness.git .sandbox/harness
git -C .sandbox/harness checkout 47f943859bef60e4160492346772ded9b24f765a
pnpm --dir .sandbox/harness install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir .sandbox/harness run build
pnpm run check
```

`DSH_HARNESS_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/deepseek-harness` selects another read-only
development checkout. `pnpm run check` runs strict type checks, ESLint, unit and
composition tests, Host/browser builds, coverage, and a package dry run. Built
`lib/` artifacts are committed because GitHub profile installs do not run a
build step.

The complete product and security design is in [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).

## Compatibility

Version 0.3.0 targets the DSH developer-preview API at the verified revision
above. DSH does not yet promise stable external plugin compatibility; future
Harness changes may require a new DSH Local Share release.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Never include a real credential or private
Session in a public issue.
