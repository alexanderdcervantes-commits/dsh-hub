# dsh-autovision

**Vision for text-only models inside DeepSeek Harness — paste an image, and a configured multimodal model transcribes it to text automatically. No model switching, no built-in keys, no relay.**

`dsh-autovision` gives text-only models (DeepSeek, GLM, …) real image support in the DeepSeek Harness web UI. It registers a transparent **twin provider** for every pure-text model, routes image-bearing requests to a multimodal model you configure yourself, and feeds the transcription back as text — so the text model "sees" the image without you switching models or touching the request.

⭐ If this plugin saves you time, please [star the repo](https://github.com/Junkrat9527/dsh-autovision) — it helps other dsh users find it.

## Why

DeepSeek Harness only lets a model receive images when that model declares image input (`inputModalities`). Pure-text models (e.g. `deepseek-*`, `glm-*`) reject image messages — pasting a screenshot into a session either fails silently or errors out.

Existing workarounds made you switch models, use a third-party relay, or hardcode a key. `dsh-autovision` keeps your setup: **the plugin never ships a key, never proxies through a relay, and never touches your model config.** It simply borrows the multimodal model you already configured in dsh settings to transcribe images to text.

## Features

- **Zero-friction, transparent** — every pure-text model gets a `<provider>-autovision` twin registered at runtime. `agent/request` auto-redirects each request to the twin, so **you never switch models and never edit `settings.yaml`**.
- **Paste → text, automatically** — attach an image in the composer; it is transcribed by your configured vision model and injected into the text model's context. The original image stays visible in the UI (thumbnail + message), and the durable log keeps the original.
- **Clean model selector** — the twin's `listModels` returns `[]`, so the model picker shows only your real models. No noise.
- **Agent-callable `autovision_read_image` tool** — the model can actively read an image file during a run, with its own per-task prompt (e.g. "transcribe every word", "describe the UI state").
- **No built-in credentials** — the recognition engine is whatever multimodal model you configure as the default vision model in the plugin settings (e.g. `opencode-go`, `minimax-m3`). No API key, no relay URL, nothing hardcoded.
- **Survives `dsh upgrade`** — pure plugin implementation, zero patches to dsh core, zero config rewrites.

## Install

Requires **dsh web ≥ 0.1.0-rc.6**.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @iroam2375/dsh-autovision
```

> The npm package is published as **`@iroam2375/dsh-autovision`** (the bare name `dsh-autovision` is unavailable on npm — too similar to the existing `dsh-auto-vision`). The plugin itself is still addressed by its bundle id `dsh-autovision`.

Restart `dsh web`, open **设置 → 插件** (plugin settings) → **Autovision**, and pick a **default vision model** (any multimodal model available in your LLM providers, e.g. `minimax-m3` / `opencode-go`). That model does all the transcribing; nothing else is configured.

> If you develop locally, the standard bundle wiring is used: add `"dsh-autovision"` to `dsh.profile.bundles` in your profile's `package.json`. Do **not** also manually `insert` it into `cordis.patch.yml` — that produces `duplicate loader entry id: autovision` at boot.

## Usage

1. **Paste an image** into any session and send — the text model receives a faithful text transcription instead of the raw image.
2. **Ask the model to read a file** — the model may call `autovision_read_image` with a file path (and its own instruction) and act on the result.

### Configuration

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `defaultVisionModel` | Multimodal model used for transcription (from your LLM providers). No vision model → transcription degrades to a fixed placeholder instead of crashing. |
| `prompt` | Optional custom instruction for the vision model. Empty → an open-ended description prompt (text, colors, shapes, UI elements, layout, state). |
| `targetProviders` | Optional whitelist of providers to wrap (default: all). |

## How it works

- For each pure-text model, the plugin registers a **twin adapter** (`<provider>-autovision`) that declares `inputModalities: ['text', 'image']`.
- `agent/request` (prepended) redirects each request to the twin; the twin's `stream()` walks every image block in the wire messages (including tool-result nesting), transcribes each via the configured vision model (LRU-cached), and forwards text upstream.
- `read_image` tool calls pass because the twin declares image input.
- A runtime wrapper on `ctx.llm.resolveModelInfo` lets you manually switch to any wrapped text model mid-session without rejection — the request still routes through the twin.

## Known limits

- A brand-new session whose **very first** message already contains an image is silently skipped; send one text message first and everything after works.
- Images up to 5 MB (attachment-local default).
- Transcription latency is the vision model's latency (e.g. 6–9 s for `minimax-m3`), mitigated by an LRU cache.
- The settings page may show one bare provider row (`opencode-go-autovision`) with no address — cosmetic only, does not affect function.

## Roadmap

- npm publishing (coming).
