# dsh-webui-launcher — cross-platform Web UI launcher for DeepSeek Harness

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

A DSH plugin that starts, stops, checks and opens the DeepSeek Harness Web UI from inside the harness — cross-platform (Windows / macOS / Linux), no desktop scripts needed.

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:YV3507/dsh-webui-launcher
```

or from a checkout:

```sh
cd dsh-webui-launcher
npm install && npm run build
dsh plugin --profile web add .
```

## What it adds

- Model tools `webui_status`, `webui_start`, `webui_stop`, `webui_open` — start the Web UI (spawning `dsh --profile web` in the background), wait until it answers HTTP 200, report or stop it, open the default browser.
- A `/webui start|stop|status|open` slash command.
- A "Web UI Launcher" card on the Settings page of the web GUI (browser half, `exports["./client"]`), driving the same `/webui/*` JSON endpoints.
- **Desktop shortcut**: on the first plugin start, a launcher shortcut is created on the desktop (`.lnk` on Windows, `.desktop` on Linux, `.command` on macOS) that starts the Web UI and opens the browser once ready. Headless hosts (no Desktop, no DISPLAY) skip creation silently — the plugin never crashes on a server. Disable with `desktopShortcut: false`.
- **dsh default icon**: the shortcut uses the official dsh icon by default (the web app favicon rasterized and bundled in the plugin's `assets/`; `.ico` on Windows, `.png` on Linux). The icon is copied into the persistent state directory, so a plugin reinstall never orphans it.
- **Custom shortcut icon**: upload any image (PNG/JPEG/BMP/GIF/TIFF) from the Settings card; it is converted automatically (multi-size `.ico` on Windows, `.png` on Linux) and the existing shortcut's icon is updated immediately. Without a shortcut (headless/disabled), the converted icon is still persisted for a future creation. An explicit `shortcutIconPath` config overrides the default icon.
- Plugin config: `port` (default 3080), `host` (127.0.0.1), `cliBin` ("" = reuse the running CLI), `startupTimeoutMs` (120000), `openBrowserOnStart` (true), `desktopShortcut` (true), `shortcutName` ("DeepSeek Harness Web UI"), `shortcutIconPath` ("" = use the bundled dsh default icon; a path overrides it).

## Behavior and robustness

- **Adopt-or-start**: a server already listening on the port is adopted — never restarted, never stopped. `webui_stop` kills the process tree this plugin spawned, and also an adopted server whose PID the desktop launcher (or an earlier plugin instance) recorded — only when the recorded PID is the one currently listening, and with the same node.exe identity guard before killing. A foreign server without a PID record is never touched.
- **Explicit state machine**: `idle → starting → running → stopping`, with single-flight serialization — concurrent `start`/`stop` calls never interleave.
- **Orphan cleanup**: when the plugin unloads or hot-reloads, any server it spawned — and any PID-recorded launcher server — is stopped (`ctx.effect` dispose).
- **PID identity guard**: before killing, the process is re-checked (alive, still our child, and on Windows still `node.exe` via tasklist) so a recycled PID is never touched.
- **Abort/timeout hygiene**: an aborted or timed-out start kills the child it spawned and surfaces the output tail in the error.
- **CLI location fallback chain**: the running CLI (`process.argv[1]`) → the `@deepseek-ai/dsh` package → explicit `cliBin` config; resolution failure throws an actionable error.

## Development

```sh
npm run build    # esbuild → lib/index.js (host) + lib/client.js (browser)
npm test         # node --test, zero-dependency (mocks the two external packages)
```

The state-machine failure paths (child death, timeout, abort, sibling adoption, concurrency, dispose) are unit-tested against the built bundle with scripted fake dependencies — no real processes or timers.

## Security

Loopback-only by default, no elevation, no external network. The plugin kills only the process tree it spawned, after verifying the PID still belongs to that process.
