# dsh-paste-to-path

> **A universal attachment dock for DSH.**

English | [简体中文](./README.zh.md)

`dsh-paste-to-path` adds a general-purpose attachment Dock to the DSH Web composer.

Paste or drop images, PDFs, Word and Excel documents, archives, code, logs, and other files, then review and manage them together before sending.

</p>

<p align="center"><em>Images, PDFs, archives, and other formats share one attachment Dock.</em></p>

The DSH `0.1.0-rc.6` Web composer natively accepts PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF. PDFs, Office documents, archives, and other formats do not currently have the same unified attachment entry point. Even an image may fail when the selected model does not support image input or the active adapter is text-only.

`dsh-paste-to-path` does not extend the model's native content types. It takes a simpler route:

```text
File
  ↓
DSH Host
  ↓
Local path
  ↓
Agent
  ↓
Your own tools
```

Send images to your own vision tool, PDFs to a document reader, and archives to shell or extraction tools.

The plugin owns **attachment intake, management, and path delivery**. Your Agent tool stack decides how to read the file.

## What it does

### Universal attachment Dock

Paste or drop a file and an attachment card appears above the composer.

Each card shows the file name, size, category, and path. You can remove it before sending.

Images also have thumbnails and lightbox previews.

---

### One flow for many file types

Images, PDFs, Office documents, code, logs, archives, and other binary files all use the same attachment flow:

```text
File → Save on Host → Path reference → Agent
```

You do not need a separate model-input protocol for every file type.

---

### Turn long pasted text into an attachment

Normal text still pastes normally.

When pasted content crosses the configured threshold, the plugin can save it as a `.txt` file instead of putting tens of thousands of characters directly into the composer.

The default threshold is `8000` characters.

---

### Edit text files before sending

Text and code attachments can be edited directly in the Dock when they are below the configured size limit.

The default limit is 1 MiB.

---

### Open files with the system application

For a local DSH deployment, `host.openPath` can open an attachment with the system's default application.

---

## Installation

Install into a DSH Web profile:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-paste-to-path
```

Before the npm release, you can also install directly from GitHub:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Johnny-xuan/dsh-paste-to-path
```

Restart DSH after installation:

```bash
dsh web
```

The package includes a `dsh.bundle` manifest, so the required loader patch is loaded with the plugin.

---

## How it works

When you paste or drop a file into the composer, the plugin catches it and saves it on the DSH Host:

```text
<workspace>/.dsh/pastes/<category>/
```

The composer does not contain the file's contents. It keeps an attachment reference instead.

When you send the message, DSH's reference codec expands that reference into a short path instruction:

```text
Paste / drop file
        │
        ▼
Save on DSH Host
        │
        ▼
Attachment Dock
shows the file card
        │
        ▼
Send message
        │
        ▼
reference codec
creates a path instruction
        │
        ▼
Agent receives the path
        │
        ▼
Uses an available tool to read it
```

The implementation uses DSH's extension mechanisms:

- `conversation.input.dock`
- input-trigger reference codec

No DSH core modification is required.

---

## What the Agent receives

The plugin does not put file bytes in the initial model request.

For example, a PDF expands to:

```text
Document attachment: /absolute/path/to/report.pdf
Read it using an appropriate tool for this file format.
```

An image expands similarly:

```text
Image attachment: /absolute/path/to/image.png
Inspect it using an available image-reading method.
```

Text, code, archives, and other formats receive equivalent path instructions.

The instructions do not require a particular tool. The Agent decides what to do next from the tools that are actually available in the current session.

---

## Bring your own tools

`dsh-paste-to-path` does not parse file contents.

Connect whichever tools fit your Agent environment, for example:

- images → your own `read_image` or vision tool
- PDF / Word / Excel → document readers
- scans → OCR
- code / logs → shell or filesystem tools
- ZIP / TAR → archive extractors

The plugin does not install these tools or assume that the current model has their capabilities.

Any compatible tool that can access the file path on the DSH Host can read the stored attachment.

If the Agent has no suitable tool, the file still enters the Dock and is saved on the Host, but the Agent cannot understand its contents.

---

## Why paths

In DSH's native attachment path, supported file formats and model capabilities are closely related.

In `0.1.0-rc.6`, the Web composer currently accepts:

- PNG
- JPEG
- WebP
- GIF

Other MIME types do not enter the same native image path.

An image that passes the format check may still fail if it reaches a model without image input or a text-only adapter.

`dsh-paste-to-path` separates two concerns:

```text
Give the file to the Agent
```

and:

```text
Understand the file's contents
```

The plugin handles only the first.

The file becomes an ordinary file on the Host. The Agent's tool layer handles the second.

---

## Configuration

Default configuration is provided by `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: paste-to-path
      name: dsh-paste-to-path
      config:
        longTextAsAttachment: true
        longTextThreshold: 8000
        maxBytes: 26214400
        editableTextMaxBytes: 1048576
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `longTextAsAttachment` | `true` | Save long pasted text as a `.txt` attachment |
| `longTextThreshold` | `8000` | Character threshold for long-text conversion |
| `maxBytes` | 25 MiB | Maximum size of one attachment |
| `editableTextMaxBytes` | 1 MiB | Maximum text-file size editable in the Dock |

On a local DSH Web deployment, these values are also available under **Settings → Plugins → Paste to Path**. Changes are persisted through DSH settings and apply without restarting the plugin. The reset button returns all four values to the profile defaults shown above.

The attachment Dock, notifications, and settings card follow DSH's **Language** preference and include English and Simplified Chinese. The path instructions serialized for the Agent remain stable English protocol text and do not change with the UI language.

The settings card is intentionally local-only. When the Web UI connects to a remote DSH Host, configure the `paste-to-path` entry in that profile's `cordis.patch.yml` instead. Attachment handling remains active with the Host-provided configuration even when the settings card is unavailable.

---

## File storage

With a workspace, attachments are stored under:

```text
<workspace>/.dsh/pastes/<category>/
```

Without a workspace, storage falls back to:

```text
$DSH_HOME/tmp-paste/<category>/
```

File permissions are:

```text
0600
```

Removing an attachment from the Dock removes only its reference from the current draft. It does not delete the file from disk.

The path therefore remains valid for undo, re-send, or later reference.

---

## Privacy

Files are uploaded from the browser to your own DSH Host and saved on the Host's local filesystem.

The plugin itself does not:

- upload files directly to a model provider
- upload files to a third-party file service
- parse file contents during upload

The initial model request contains only the file path and a short instruction.

If the Agent later uses another tool or external service to process the file, that tool's own behavior and configuration apply.

---

## Design boundary

`dsh-paste-to-path` owns only this part:

```text
File
  ↓
Attachment Dock
  ↓
Host filesystem
  ↓
Path reference
```

This part:

```text
Path
  ↓
Vision / PDF Reader / OCR / Shell / ...
```

belongs to the Agent's tool layer.

The plugin therefore does not:

- modify or replace a model adapter
- pretend that the model supports vision
- bind the workflow to a fixed vision, OCR, or document tool
- parse attachment contents during transport
- create a native DSH `image` content block

---

## Compatibility

Tested with:

```text
DeepSeek Harness 0.1.0-rc.6
```

DSH is currently a developer preview. Changes to its extension interfaces may require a corresponding plugin update.
