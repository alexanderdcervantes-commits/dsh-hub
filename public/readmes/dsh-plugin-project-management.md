# dsh-plugin-project-management

A [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) plugin that
interviews the user about a project, generates a project timeline / Gantt chart,
and exports it as **Word** or **Excel**.

The agent owns the loop: it runs a structured interview (via the
`project-interview` skill), decomposes features into tasks, and uses five tools
to validate, schedule, adjust, persist, and export. The scheduling math is
deterministic. The project (definition + timeline) is persisted to a workspace
project file (`data/project_management/project_data.json`) so it survives across
sessions, and the plugin reminds the agent about an existing timeline on
session resume.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pm_project_define` | Validate/normalize the interview result into a canonical `ProjectDefinition` (features, priorities, dates, milestones, agent budget per duration, constraints); persists it |
| `pm_timeline_generate` | Deterministic scheduler: dependency-aware, workday-aware dating (weekends + the country's public holidays via `calendar.country`), critical path, deadline + budget feasibility checks; persists definition + timeline |
| `pm_timeline_update` | Patch tasks (rename, dependencies, effort, agents, manual date pins), re-schedule, and persist |
| `pm_project_load` | Load the saved project (definition + timeline) from `data/project_management/project_data.json` — use when resuming a session |
| `pm_timeline_export` | Write `.docx` (summary, task schedule, milestones, budget) or `.xlsx` (Summary, Tasks, colored Gantt sheet) |

## Skill

- `project-interview` — the conversational interview protocol: features →
  priorities → timeline/milestones → **agent budget per duration** (hours /
  cost / agents / custom, with a period) → constraints.

## Install

Build the plugin (server + browser bundle), then load it with a Cordis overlay
patch:

```sh
npm install
npm run build       # tsc server → dist/, esbuild client → lib/client.js
```

### From GitHub

The `prepare` script builds both halves automatically, so GitHub installs work
without committing `dist/`/`lib/` (they are gitignored). Install the plugin
into the `web` profile directly from GitHub:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Luke-Yong/dsh-plugin-project-management
```

This forwards `pnpm add github:Luke-Yong/dsh-plugin-project-management` inside
the profile directory. Equivalent to installing the package into a DeepSeek
Harness checkout manually:

```sh
npm install github:Luke-Yong/dsh-plugin-project-management
```

`./package.json` is exported for tooling that needs the `dsh.client` manifest.

From a DeepSeek Harness checkout:

```sh
pnpm dsh web --patch /absolute/path/to/dsh-plugin-project-management/cordis.yml
```

The plugin package must be resolvable from the config tree's baseUrl — install
or `pnpm link` it into the harness checkout (it is a dependency of the cordis.yml
package, per the client-modules resolution rule).

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3080` and ask, for example:

> Plan a timeline for my mobile app and export it as both Word and Excel.

## Web UI

![Project management Web UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luke-Yong/dsh-plugin-project-management/b10c38fa50b4d195971f649444e1326d0900febf/Screenshot.png)

The plugin ships a browser half with two surfaces:

- A **Project** tab in the conversation header's view tabs (the
  `conversation.view` slot — the same mechanism ui-trajectory uses). Note:
  the view-tab ring only appears once the session is active (≥ 1 turn).
- A **compact project dock** inside the composer stack (`conversation.input.dock`)
  that renders even for blank sessions and auto-appears when a project exists,
  so project management is reachable before the tabs show.

Selecting the tab (or reading the dock) shows: project name, description, and
last-updated time; timeline span, task count, and feasibility; phases, critical
path, milestones, and open conflicts; the agent budget model.

The pane reads the saved project state for the current session from
`/plugins/project-management/state` (server resolves the session cwd — session
header → workspace registry → process cwd — and reads
`data/project_management/project_data.json`). No harness patch is required —
both surfaces work with the stock web app.

## Flow

1. The agent interviews you (features, deadline, milestones, agent budget per
   duration).
2. It calls `pm_project_define` to lock in and persist the definition.
3. It decomposes features into tasks and calls `pm_timeline_generate`.
4. It reviews feasibility with you and adjusts via `pm_timeline_update`.
5. It exports with `pm_timeline_export` (`format: docx | xlsx`).

## Persistence & session resume

- The definition and timeline are saved to `<workspace>/data/project_management/project_data.json`
  in the project-plan schema used by `templates/gantt.html` (project, tiers,
  phases, tasks, milestones, sprints — plus a `_dsh` block for plugin
  round-trip state). Layout follows the Project-Journey Planner example:
   `data/project_management/project_data.json` consumed by `templates/gantt.html`.
- On a new session in the same workspace, the plugin injects a reminder into
  the model context when a timeline exists, telling the agent about the saved
  plan and its conflicts; the agent then calls `pm_project_load` to continue.
- Writes are atomic (temp file + rename). A legacy `.dsh-pm/project.json` is
  read as a fallback for backward compatibility.

## Notes / MVP limitations

- A single project per workspace.

## Roadmap

- Custom Web UI Gantt view via `presentCall` / `presentResult`.
- Multi-project and live agent-budget tracking.
