# dsh-rewind

[简体中文](README.zh.md)

In-place conversation rewind for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness): the Claude Code `/rewind` semantics inside the **same session window** — cut the model context back to an earlier user message, and optionally restore workspace files from **disk-persisted before-backups**.

> **Status:** published to npm (`dsh-rewind-plugin`, v0.2.7) via GitHub Actions Trusted Publishing + Sigstore provenance. Targets the web profile (`dsh --profile web`). Interaction mirrors Claude Code's rewind, adapted to dsh's real web UI.
>
> **v0.2.7 highlights:** composer refill is event-driven (reopening a session never resurrects withdrawn text); subagent edits are not tracked (Claude Code alignment); concurrent rewinds are guarded; the code-restore option appears only when tracked changes exist (mixed host/client versions safe).

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| In-place rewind | Rewind to **any** user message from a per-message ↶ button: the target message and everything after it (agent replies, tool calls) are withdrawn from the model context *and* the rendered transcript — no new session, no window switch |
| Time-travel semantics | Rewinding to a message withdraws **that message too**; its text is offered back in the composer so you can edit and re-send it |
| Claude-Code-style file restore | Write-class edits are backed up **before** they happen and persisted on disk; "conversation and code" restores files to their pre-edit content and deletes files created after the target |
| Impact preview | "Conversation and code" first shows the exact restore / delete list for confirmation (the option is hidden when there are no tracked changes — like Claude Code's code-restore visibility) |
| Approval-plugin coexistence | Capture runs at the `tools/execute` around-dispatch stage, so another plugin's pre-execute approval short-circuit (e.g. dsh-edit-approval) cannot skip the backup, and a denied call never records |
| Paths resolved by session cwd | Relative paths are backed up and restored against the **real** file using the fs-tools session-cwd rule; the resolved display path is what gets recorded |
| Restores write real files | Restore goes through plain `node:fs` directly to the filesystem; symbolic and hard links are skipped with a warning (no clobber through a shared inode) |
| Survives host restart | Backups live on disk under `~/.dsh/rewind-snapshots/<session>/<anchor seq>/`, newest 100 message groups per session |
| Localized | `zh` / `en` copy registered into the dsh locale system |

## How it works

Two halves work together: the **conversation rewind** (in-place, same window) and the **checkpoint file restore** (Claude-Code-style before-backups).

### 1. Conversation rewind

The plugin appends an **empty-content marker** `assistant/message` into the session log whose `surfaceOp: { op: 'replace', start, end }` replaces every surface node after the target message with the marker:

- The marker carries `sourceEventSeqs` covering every shadowed node, and the `Session.append` surface rules validate the cut (only a contiguous range on the current surface).
- Because the marker is **empty**, the harness derives it to `null` — it never enters the model context and never renders as conversation content. The agent and the user both see the conversation exactly as it was at the target.
- The marker's **turn number reuses the LAST STARTED turn** (`markerTurnOf`), never `lastTurn + 1`: the harness's agent loop numbers its next real turn exactly `last turn/start + 1`, so a marker numbered the same way would leave an `assistant/message` BEFORE the `turn/start` of the same turn — the client conversation-context builder rejects that ordering with `conversation Context …:turn-tail… received an update before its start Match`, history load fails, and the whole conversation disappears from the UI (the real defect in ≤ 0.2.4, fixed in 0.2.5). Reusing an already-consumed turn makes the marker a harmless trailing update on the previous completed turn's tail — it can never collide with a future turn.
- The append-only log is **untouched** — the audit trail keeps every withdrawn event; only the model-visible surface is cut, so the next request derives its context from the target onward.

A running turn (LLM thinking / streaming) is force-stopped first (`cancel({ kind: 'user' })`) and the rewind waits for quiescence; if it can't stop, the rewind is aborted with an error.

### 2. Checkpoint file restore

The plugin tracks the write-class tools — `write`, `edit`, `str_replace_editor` (mutating commands `create` / `str_replace` / `insert`):

1. **Before-capture** at `tools/execute` (the around-dispatch stage): the target file is read and the resolved path + content are held in a pending map. This stage only runs after any pre-execute approval gate let the call through — so an `ask` short-circuit (dsh-edit-approval) **cannot skip** the backup, and a denied call never records.
2. **Disk commit** at `tools/post-execute`: the before-backup is written under the turn's **anchor message seq** (`~/.dsh/rewind-snapshots/<session>/<anchor seq>/<callId>.json`).
3. **Restore** (`/rewind @<seq> both`): every backup anchored at or after the target applies — modified files are written back to their **earliest** captured before-state, files created after the target are deleted, symbolic / hard links are skipped. Writes go through plain `node:fs`, independent of the fs service.
4. A failed tool body that **throws** skips `tools/post-execute`; a `tools/result` safety net clears the pending capture so nothing leaks in memory.

Backups persist across host restarts, bounded to the newest 100 anchor groups per session.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting: history load failure (`…turn-tail… received an update before its start Match`)

Versions ≤ 0.2.4 corrupted client replay when a rewind was **followed by further
conversation**: the marker's turn number collided with the next real turn's
`turn/start`, so reopening the session showed
`Failed to load history: conversation Context …:turn-tail… received an update before its start Match (internal)`
and the history vanished. Rewinds created from 0.2.5 on no longer produce the
collision, but **already-corrupted sessions need an offline repair** (the log is
append-only — it cannot be rewritten in memory).

The repair tool ships **inside the npm package** (`dsh-rewind-repair`) — no
source checkout needed:

```sh
# 1. Fully quit dsh web / host first (while a session is resident in memory,
#    a disk repair is overwritten by the next checkpoint)
# 2. Run the offline repair (scans every session under ~/.dsh/sessions,
#    rewriting each marker's turn back to the last started turn)
npm exec --yes --package=dsh-rewind-plugin -- dsh-rewind-repair
npm exec --yes --package=dsh-rewind-plugin -- dsh-rewind-repair -- --dry-run  # preview only
# 3. Restart dsh web — the repaired sessions load their history again
```

Or install it globally once (`npm i -g dsh-rewind-plugin`) and run
`dsh-rewind-repair` directly; from a source checkout the same tool is
`node scripts/repair-markers.mjs` (identical flags).

The tool only rewrites the `data.turn` of `dsh-rewind` empty-marker events
(keeping seqs, order, and the zstd frame structure intact), backs up the original
file to `session.jsonl.zstd.bak-<timestamp>` before writing, and never touches
any other event — safe to run repeatedly.

## 📦 Install

Published to npm — the registry path is the recommended one. **Restart dsh web (`--profile web`) after installing.**

> ⚠️ Note: the npm name `dsh-rewind` belongs to another author's package — install with `dsh-rewind-plugin`.

### Option A: registry (recommended)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-rewind-plugin
```

### Option B: local checkout (authors / contributors)

```sh
cd dsh-rewind
npm install      # devDeps come from the npm registry; no harness checkout needed
npm run build    # full build: lib/ (host ESM + client bundle + .d.ts)
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-rewind   # link install
```

### Option C: GitHub (pin a commit for reproducibility)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:SiriLee/dsh-rewind#<commit-sha>
```

First run fails: pnpm blocks git dependencies from running build scripts. Follow
the CLI hint to add an `allowBuilds` key to the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
(e.g. `$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/pnpm-workspace.yaml`), then retry. pnpm then runs
the plugin's `prepare` (full build) and installs it into the profile.

## Usage

### Rewind via the per-message button

1. **Hover** any user message you sent — a **↶ rewind** button appears in its action row.
2. **Click it.** The target is that message (step one is done). A small popover opens (step two):
   - **Rewind conversation only** — cut the model context back to before the message; workspace files stay untouched.
   - **Rewind conversation and code** — same context cut, plus workspace files restored to their state before the message. An impact list (files to restore / delete) is shown first, then you confirm.
   - The "conversation and code" option is **hidden** when no tracked file changes exist after the target (matching Claude Code's behavior).
3. The rewind executes as an in-session command; a result message confirms (e.g. "已撤回 seq N 及之后内容；还原 M 个文件"), and the withdrawn message's text is filled back into the composer for editing and re-sending.

### Rewinds are time-travel

Rewinding to a message **withdraws** it and everything after it — the transcript and the agent's context both return to before the message. The command result says so, and the message's text is offered back in the composer.

### Manual `/rewind` is blocked

`/rewind` exists only as the button's internal channel. Typing `/rewind` (bare or with arguments) into the composer is **intercepted** — submitting shows a transient hint pointing at the ↶ button.

## Behavior details & limitations

- Only **write-class tools** running while the plugin is active are tracked (`write` / `edit` / `str_replace_editor`). Changes made by `bash`, other tools, or external programs are not backed up and cannot be restored — the same limitation as Claude Code, which also defers such rollbacks to the user's git.
- **Subagent edits are not tracked** — same as Claude Code. A subagent runs its own session, so its backups could never be restored by a rewind of the parent session; the capture is skipped instead of recording to an unreachable store.
- If a before-capture read fails (e.g. a permission error), that change is simply not backed up and a `both` rewind cannot restore it — the plugin logs a warning but **does not block the write**.
- File restore/delete writes through the **real local filesystem**; under sandbox / remote backends path resolution may be restricted.
- Symbolic links and hard links are not written through (they share the inode with another name; a restore would clobber both) — they are skipped and reported.
- A rewind can itself be rewound (its marker enters the log), but the file-restore action is not re-backed up.
- The ↶ button is injected on user messages rendered in the **current session view**; switch to another session before rewinding it.
- When no tracked file changes exist after the target, the mode popover offers only "conversation only" (Claude Code hides code-restore options the same way).

## Not included

- Keyboard shortcuts (esc+esc to open the rewind menu) — planned as a follow-up.
- `/compact` — provided by the harness.
- Fork / branch rewind — the harness's built-in "branch in new chat".
- Whole-tree / git-first snapshots covering bash and external edits — **deliberately not implemented**, in line with Claude Code's native rewind (which also defers such rollbacks to the user's git).

## Compatibility

- Node.js `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`.
- DeepSeek Harness web profile (`dsh --profile web`); peer `@deepseek-ai/*` packages are resolved by the harness at runtime.

> [!WARNING]
> This project and DeepSeek Harness are both in developer preview. Pin exact
> versions in reproducible environments and review the behavior notes above.

## Development

```sh
npm install            # devDeps from the npm registry
npm run typecheck      # tsc on both compilation surfaces (host + client)
npm test               # vitest: rewind / snapshot / hidden / session-cwd / integration (46 cases)
npm run build          # esbuild: lib/index.js (host ESM) + lib/client.js (loader closure) + .d.ts
node scripts/verify-host.mjs   # boot the BUILT host artifact end-to-end (18 checks)
```

`prepare` runs the full build, so git installs and `npm pack` / `npm publish`
always produce a complete `lib/` and the `LICENSE`.

Maintainers: see [docs/harness-reference.md](docs/harness-reference.md) for the
DeepSeek Harness interface reference (subsystem docs + key source index).

## Publishing

Releases go out through GitHub Actions Trusted Publishing (OIDC, no stored
`NPM_TOKEN`):

```sh
npm version patch && git push origin main --tags   # triggers .github/workflows/publish.yml
```

- The workflow verifies the tag matches `package.json`, runs typecheck + tests +
  a full build + artifact verification, publishes with `--provenance`
  (Sigstore), and creates a GitHub Release. It is **idempotent** — an already
  published version is skipped. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same
  checks on every push / PR, plus a `npm pack --dry-run` sanity check that the
  tarball carries `lib/` and `LICENSE`.
- One-time npm-side configuration (cannot be done from this repo): open
  [dsh-rewind-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-rewind-plugin) →
  **settings → Trusted Publisher → Add**, with Provider **GitHub Actions** ·
  Organization or user **`SiriLee`** · Repository **`dsh-rewind`** (the GitHub
  repo, not the npm name) · Workflow filename **`publish.yml`** · Environment
  **empty** · Allowed actions **`npm publish`**. Once configured, pushes of
  `v<version>` tags publish automatically.
