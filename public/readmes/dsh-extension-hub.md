<details>
<summary><b>New in v0.2.19</b> — the <b>Add-ons</b> block now carries <a href="https://github.com/shaobeichen/dsh-pocket">dsh-pocket</a>: DeepSeek Harness in your pocket — run dsh web on your PC and sync access from your phone by scanning a QR code (LAN + public network, real-time screen mirroring). <i>(click to expand earlier highlights)</i></summary>

**New in v0.2.18** — the **Add-ons** block now carries [odai-dsh-plugin](https://github.com/orziz/odai) (profile-wide Odai governance & responsibility routing) and [dsh-cost-meter](https://github.com/Han-1413141/dsh-cost-meter) (session cost & token statistics, budgets, balances and Coding Plan quotas).

**New in v0.2.15** — the **Add-ons** block now carries [dsh-vision-toolkit](https://github.com/Anionex/dsh-vision-toolkit): a more powerful vision toolkit — paste an image directly for image understanding, UI restoration, long-screenshot analysis, and more visual tasks.

**New in v0.2.8** — **one-command install**: the package now ships a bundle layer, so `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-extension-hub` wires the plugin row into your profile automatically (no more manual `cordis.patch.yml` edits in the quick start).

**New in v0.2.7** — the **Add-ons** block now also carries [dsh-recall](https://github.com/Relistencode/dsh-recall): conversation history recall for DSH — literal/fuzzy/semantic retrieval over every past session, fully local & offline.

**New in v0.2.6** — A curated plugin store inside DSH: browse 400+ community-curated plugins (11 categories, bilingual descriptions), install from npm in seconds with anti-squatting checks, search every GitHub `dsh-plugin` repo — and keep them updated. Plus [dsh-myrules](https://github.com/Relistencode/dsh-extension-hub/blob/main/packages/dsh-myrules/README.md) — a companion plugin to edit your host-wide global instructions from the settings page. And a new **Add-ons** block in the Plugin Management tab: install, disable, uninstall and update companion features together with the main plugin.

Manage DeepSeek Harness (DSH) skills and MCP servers from one place.

Skills management · MCP servers · Skill import · Plugin management · Plugin market

A service-oriented extension center for DeepSeek Harness: a zero-dependency persistence core and CLI, plus a durable settings-page UI embedded in DSH Web — create / edit / enable / disable skills and MCP servers, one-click import from Claude Code and OpenAI Codex, and a full plugin manager (official vs third-party, enable / disable / uninstall, check & update, plus a Plugin Market with a curated store and GitHub search).

🌏 [中文](README.zh.md) · English

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: DSH installed and running (`dsh web` works), Node.js ≥ 22, pnpm ≥ 10.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-extension-hub@0.2.19
```

One command: the package ships its own composition patch (bundle layer), so the plugin row is wired into your profile automatically — no manual `cordis.patch.yml` edits. Restart `dsh web`, then open **Settings → Extension Management**.

Install once — use the header's **Check Updates** button to upgrade later.

## Features

| Feature | CLI | Settings UI |
|---|---|---|
| List skills / MCP (enabled state, scope) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create / edit / delete skills | ✅ | ✅ (form + Markdown body) |
| Enable / disable skills & MCP | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create / edit / delete MCP (stdio / streamable-http) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Import skills & MCP from Claude / Codex and other tools | ✅ | ✅ |
| Project-scope install with folder picker | ✅ (`folder` cmd) | ✅ (DSH directory picker) |
| Manage plugins (official vs other, enable / disable / uninstall) | — | ✅ |
| Plugin Market: curated store (npm install) + GitHub search | — | ✅ |
| Check & update third-party plugins | — | ✅ |
| [dsh-myrules](https://github.com/Relistencode/dsh-extension-hub/blob/main/packages/dsh-myrules/README.md) — edit host-wide global instructions (Customize page); search "dsh-myrules" in the plugin manager to disable or uninstall it | — | ✅ |
| Add-on manager: install / disable / uninstall companion features, update together with the main plugin | — | ✅ |

**Built-in skills are read-only**: the list also shows skills bundled with the
deployment (shipped presets, e.g. the `cordis` preset's skills) and skills
shipped inside user presets, marked "Built-in/Preset" and not editable /
deletable / toggleable — they belong to the deployment or preset layer. To
override, create a same-name skill in the user or project directory.

## Plugin Management Guide

The **Extension Management** page ships a full plugin manager since v0.2.0,
with four tabs: **Skills / MCP Servers / Plugins / Plugin Market**.

![Extension Hub overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Relistencode/dsh-extension-hub/ef7021ce3263f85e7ac981e095d1ba1370529ca6/docs/screenshots/feature-overview.png)

### Managing installed plugins

The **Plugins** tab lists every plugin row in your DSH composition, split into
two collapsible groups:

- **Official Plugins** — DeepSeek's own `@deepseek-ai/*` packages (collapsed by
  default). They can be disabled but not uninstalled; the `cordis:include`
  entry is the composition loader itself and is marked **Core** — it cannot be
  disabled or removed.
- **Other Plugins** — third-party and your own plugins (e.g. this one).

Click a plugin to see its details: description, source, repository link, entry
id and module name. From the detail block you can:

- **Enable / Disable** — written to your profile `cordis.patch.yml`; takes
  effect after a `dsh web` restart. Disabling warns you that an unknown plugin
  may cause serious problems.
- **Uninstall** (non-official only) — removes the plugin row from the
  configuration, with a warning plus a second "Confirm uninstall?" step. If the
  plugin was installed via a GitHub clone, its local clone directory is deleted
  too.

The **Other Plugins** group header has **Check Updates**: it compares npm
packages against the registry and local git clones against their origin HEAD.
Updateable plugins get a green **Update Available** button next to their status
label — click it to pull the new version (npm tarball or `git pull`), or use
**Update All** to update every updateable plugin at once.

![Managing your plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Relistencode/dsh-extension-hub/ef7021ce3263f85e7ac981e095d1ba1370529ca6/docs/screenshots/manage-plugins.png)

### Discovering & installing new plugins

The **Plugin Market** tab has two sub-views:

- **Curated** (default) — a community-curated catalog
  ([awesome-dsh-plugin](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/plugins.json), refreshed
  daily) with 11 categories, bilingual descriptions, star counts and ordering
  (Featured / Top / Newest). Entries with an npm mapping install **from npm** in
  seconds (registry tarball, with an anti-squatting check that the package
  points back at the listed repository); entries without one fall back to a
  GitHub clone. A 24h local cache keeps the view usable offline.
- **Discover More** — searches GitHub for repositories tagged `dsh-plugin` (a
  free-text query narrows the search). Each result shows stars and an
  "Installed" badge when the repo is already present locally.

Click a curated/discovered entry to open its detail page — description, stars,
category (curated), install method and a link to the repository — then hit
**Install**. Extension Hub:

1. Prefers the **npm registry** when the plugin publishes to npm: downloads the
   tarball into the profile `node_modules` without pnpm (no symlink/permission
   requirements) and registers a bundle row. Packages installed this way are
   managed by Extension Hub itself — keep updating them with its **Check
   Updates**; the dependency is declared in the profile manifest, so a later
   `dsh plugin` / pnpm install keeps it.
2. Otherwise **clones** the repository (shallow) into
   `~/.dsh/extension-hub/plugins/<repo>` and verifies it ships a usable
   `package.json` entry. Clone installs support **zero-dependency** plugins
   only: packages with npm runtime dependencies are rejected (there is no
   dependency-install step), and packages that rely on a bundle patch
   (`dsh.bundle.patch`) are flagged because a clone cannot apply it. Be aware
   that a monorepo root (e.g. the repo of `dsh-myrules` is this very
   repository) clones as the root package, not the target plugin — use the npm
   or Add-ons install path for those.
3. Registers the plugin in your profile `cordis.patch.yml` (managed insert
   block) and self-checks the write.

> **Mixing install paths (Discussion #2889)**: Extension Hub installs write a
> profile patch row plus a dependency declaration. Do **not** combine this
> with the official `dsh plugin add/list/update` commands: DSH CLI appends
> every dependency declaring a `dsh.bundle.patch` to `dsh.profile.bundles`,
> duplicating the manual row and crashing `dsh web` on boot with
> `duplicate loader entry id` (see
> [deepseek-harness Discussion #2889](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/discussions/2889)).
> If you already ran a `dsh plugin` command, remove the duplicated entries
> from `dsh.profile.bundles` before restarting.

After a `dsh web` restart the plugin appears in the **Other Plugins** group,
where you can disable or uninstall it (GitHub-clone installs also remove the
clone directory) and keep it updated with **Check Updates** (npm packages
check the registry; local git clones update via `git pull`).

> Installing runs third-party code. Only install repositories you trust, and
> check the repository's own README for install instructions — a repo tagged
> `dsh-plugin` may still be a skill, an MCP server, or need a custom setup.

## Recent Updates

<details>
<summary>Recent updates (click to expand)</summary>

- **2026-08** — v0.2.19: new add-on [dsh-pocket](https://github.com/shaobeichen/dsh-pocket) — run dsh web on your PC and sync access from your phone by scanning a QR code (LAN + public network, real-time screen mirroring); install / disable / uninstall from the Add-ons block, updates together with the main plugin.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.18: two new add-ons — [odai-dsh-plugin](https://github.com/orziz/odai) (profile-wide Odai governance & responsibility routing) and [dsh-cost-meter](https://github.com/Han-1413141/dsh-cost-meter) (session cost & token statistics, budgets, balances, Coding Plan quotas, 90+ model price catalog); install / disable / uninstall from the Add-ons block, updates together with the main plugin.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.17: npm installs of bundle-patch add-ons now warn against mixing install paths — DSH CLI's bundle reconcile (`dsh plugin add/list/update`) appends every dependency declaring `dsh.bundle.patch` to `dsh.profile.bundles`, duplicating the manual row and crashing `dsh web` on boot (`duplicate loader entry id`, see [Discussion #2889](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/discussions/2889)); the README now carries the same guidance.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.16: add-on installs now warn about missing runtime dependencies — the npm installer checks the downloaded package's dependencies against the profile and appends a reminder to the result message when any are absent (the install still completes; a profile-level `pnpm install` fixes loading after restart).
- **2026-08** — v0.2.15: new add-on [dsh-vision-toolkit](https://github.com/Anionex/dsh-vision-toolkit) — a more powerful vision toolkit (paste an image directly for image understanding, UI restoration, long-screenshot analysis, and more visual tasks); install / disable / uninstall from the Add-ons block, updates together with the main plugin.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.14: **fix: add-ons / installed badges now see the bundle layer** — a feature or plugin installed via the official `dsh plugin add` (bundle) path is detected as installed (its row lives in the bundle's own patch, not the profile patch), so the Add-ons block no longer offers a duplicate install that would crash `dsh web`; `installNpmPlugin` refuses packages already registered by a bundle layer; bundle-installed add-ons are uninstalled via `dsh plugin remove` (guided in the UI) instead of profile-patch deletion.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.13: **fix (issue #2)** — `hostPatchPath()` no longer auto-probes the profiles directory (a scan could hit a headless profile before web and make the MCP list read/write the wrong composition); extension management is bound to the **web** profile, with an explicit profile name still supported.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.12: **review fixes** — MCP discovery now follows Claude/Codex precedence (project `.mcp.json` > project `.claude.json` > user configs; Codex project > global) instead of the reversed order; the MCP list shows home-level rows (`$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml`, read-only, badge-marked); composition and state writes are atomic (temp+rename, lock retries) so a crash cannot corrupt `cordis.patch.yml`; clone-install rejection messages distinguish a missing package.json from a missing build output (git installs fetch sources, not artifacts); README notes that npm-installed plugins stay managed by Extension Hub across later `dsh plugin`/pnpm runs.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.11: docs — quick-start install command pinned to the current release (the published tarball had carried the v0.2.8 command).
- **2026-08** — v0.2.10: **complete Windows fix for GitHub-clone installs** — clone rows now register a `file://` URL pointing at the clone's **entry file** (v0.2.9 pointed at the clone directory, which Node ESM still rejects with `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT` and crashed `dsh web`); clone installs also refuse packages with npm runtime dependencies (there is no dependency-install step) and warn when a package relies on a bundle patch that a clone cannot apply. To repair a broken row by hand, edit `cordis.patch.yml` and point `name` at the entry file, e.g. `name: file:///C:/Users/you/.dsh/extension-hub/plugins/foo/lib/index.js`.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.9: Windows GitHub-clone install fix (first pass) — clone rows switched from raw drive-letter paths to `file://` module names; superseded by v0.2.10 (entry-file URLs).
- **2026-08** — v0.2.8: **one-command install** — the package now ships a bundle patch (`cordis.patch.yml`), so `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-extension-hub` wires the plugin row into your profile automatically; the quick start no longer requires manual `cordis.patch.yml` edits.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.7: new add-on **dsh-recall** — conversation history recall for DSH (three-layer literal/fuzzy/semantic retrieval over every past session, fully local & offline); install / disable / uninstall from the Add-ons block, updates together with the main plugin.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.6: new **Add-ons** block in the Plugin Management tab — install / disable / enable / uninstall companion features (dsh-myrules) without leaving the page; the header **Check Updates** now checks the main plugin AND installed add-ons together and updates everything at once; collapsible block; feature i18n keys aligned with their ids; "Integrate with Extension Hub" invitation section added to both READMEs.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.5: new companion plugin **dsh-myrules** (`packages/dsh-myrules`) — a **Customize (个性化)** page in Settings that edits the host-wide global instructions (`$DSH_HOME/AGENTS.md`, injected into every session, new sessions apply immediately); theme-inverted primary buttons across the plugin manager, slim save button, percentage budget meter; rolling `.bak` backup removed.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.4: **Plugin Market with a Curated store + npm install path** — the Plugin Market tab now leads with a **Curated** view of the community catalog (awesome-dsh-plugin, 11 categories, bilingual descriptions, Featured/Top/Newest ordering, 24h offline cache) beside **Discover More** (GitHub search); plugins with an npm mapping now install from the npm registry via tarball (no pnpm, anti-squatting repo check) with GitHub clone as fallback; settings tab renamed to **Plugin Market**; curated view no longer hangs on load (client-side method registration); quoted (`@scope`) row ids match in installed detection and uninstall; README overhaul with new screenshots.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.3: fix: patch persistence semantics — 0.2.2's flat-row writer was wrong for patch files (a bare top-level `- id:` row means "override" and silently no-ops; rows must be wrapped in `- insert:`). Reverted all patch writes to the managed insert-block region; the profile patch was rebuilt to the correct format. This restores plugin loading after restart.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.2: unified flat-row patch persistence (CLI and UI write the same loader-compatible format); MCP list reads merged rows (region and flat formats); scalar quoting fix for `@`-prefixed names; uninstall removes discover-installed clone directories.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.1: Discover tab pagination ("Load more", 30 per page), plugin detail as a modal popup, truthful "Installed" badges (verified against the config row, not just the clone dir), install write-back verification, horizontal-overflow fixes.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.0: full plugin manager — official vs third-party grouping (vendor-scope based), core protection for the composition loader, enable / disable / uninstall with confirmations, per-plugin check & update (npm registry + local git clones, Update All), and a GitHub-powered **Discover** tab that clones and installs `dsh-plugin` repositories in one click.
- **2026-08** — v0.1.4: package the v0.1.3 changelog into the published artifact (registry-sync release).
- **2026-08** — v0.1.3: strict Typert descriptors (`./typert`) fix `/api/extensionHub/*` 404 in layouts where the protocol package loads twice; one-click update downloads the npm tarball directly (no pnpm).
- **2026-08** — "Check Updates" button in the header: compares the local package version against the npm registry.
- **2026-08** — Section renamed to **Extension Management** with a header ("Manage plugins, skills and MCP"); import moved from its own tab into the Skills and MCP Servers pages.
- **2026-08** — Full zh/en i18n (83 keys), project folder picker, built-in skill read-only layer.
- Initial release — CLI + durable settings UI + zero-dependency persistence core.

</details>

## How it works

- The host half (`lib/host.js`) is a `TypertRemoteService` gateway exposed
  under the `extensionHub` wire namespace; the browser half mounts its Remote
  contribution and calls the mounted namespace service.
- The browser bundle is declared via `dsh.client.platform: "web"` in
  `package.json`; DSH's client-modules system scans it at boot, injects the
  boot manifest, and serves the bundle over
  `/plugins/dsh-extension-hub/client.js` — **no web bundle rebuild required**.
- All real reads/writes run inside the host process (outside the session file
  sandbox) and share the same `lib/` code as the CLI.

## Data sources (discovery scope)

| Source | Skills | MCP |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude** | `<repo>/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | `<repo>/.mcp.json`, `~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/.claude.json` |
| **Codex** | `<repo>/.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `~/.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md` | `~/.codex/config.toml`, `<repo>/.codex/config.toml` |

Conversion: Claude/Codex `stdio` servers → DSH `transport: stdio`
(`command`/`args`/`env`); `http`/`sse` → `transport: streamable-http`
(`url`/`headers`). Skill `name`/`description`/`whenToUse` are preserved,
`license`/`allowed-tools` fold into `metadata`.

## Persistence locations

### Skills

- **Project scope** `--scope project` → `<target folder>/.dsh/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- **Global scope** `--scope global` → `~/.dsh/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

Enable/disable rewrites the `disable-model-invocation` / `user-invocable`
frontmatter flags; removal deletes the file.

### MCP

- **Global** → rows are appended/updated inside the managed region
  (`# >>> dsh-extension-hub` … `# <<< dsh-extension-hub`) of
  `~/.dsh/profiles/<profile>/cordis.patch.yml`.
- **Project** → writes a manifest `<target folder>/.dsh/mcp-servers.yaml` and
  generates a dedicated preset
  `~/.dsh/.agent-presets/<slug>-mcp/agent.cordis.yml` (based on the shipped
  `standard` preset). Select that preset in the session roster to activate
  the servers.

## Supported platforms

DSH itself runs on Windows, macOS and Linux; this plugin has no platform
specifics — the CLI works anywhere Node.js runs, and the settings UI follows
the DSH Web host.

## Known limitations

- The YAML/TOML parsers are self-contained **subsets** covering the shapes
  that actually appear in DSH compositions and Codex `config.toml`; anything
  outside them is skipped or reported, never silently corrupted.
- Skill discovery matches DSH `dsh-skill-filesystem`: only
  `<root>/<name>/SKILL.md` and `<root>/<name>.md` are recognized; names must
  be kebab-case.
- Project MCP relies on the "generated preset + manually select the preset"
  mechanism; the tool does not switch presets between sessions for you.
- Project-scope enable/disable toggles apply to the generated preset (whether
  the servers load when that preset is selected); the manifest always keeps
  the full record.
- Global MCP removal/editing only affects manager-managed rows (inside the
  managed region); hand-written patch rows are untouched.
- The curated store is a snapshot of the community registry: it refreshes on
  load with a 24h local cache, so it may trail the live registry by up to a
  day. Plugins that need a build step at install time fall back to a GitHub
  clone instead of the npm tarball path.

## Integrate with Extension Hub

DSH Extension Hub can integrate most plugins, letting users manage and keep
every related feature updated in one place. If you are interested, your plugin
is very welcome here too — together we can grow the DSH plugin ecosystem. Once
integrated, your plugin appears in the Add-ons block of the Plugin Management
tab, where users can install, disable, uninstall, and update it together with
the main plugin.

Thank you for your open-source contribution to the DSH community!
