# dsh-opencode-go-usage

[简体中文](README.zh.md) · **English**

A [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) web-GUI plugin that shows your **OpenCode Go** subscription usage in real time — a floating widget that tracks **rolling / weekly / monthly** quota for **every API key** in your pool, with color-coded progress bars and reset countdowns.

## Features

- **Floating widget** — a compact button pinned to the right edge of the page. Its badge shows the **worst window across all keys** at a glance; the color (green / orange / pulsing red) tells you whether any key is close to its quota limit.
- **Expandable panel** — click the button to open a panel with one card per key (the currently active key is marked with a ★), each showing rolling / weekly / monthly usage as progress bars, percentages, and time-until-reset. Rate-limited windows are flagged with ⚠.
- **Real-time** — the Host polls the official usage endpoint every 60 seconds (configurable); the panel refreshes automatically and has a manual refresh button.
- **Auto key-pool discovery** — reads your key pool from `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml` (any `OPENCODE_GO_KEY_<name>` entries), so there is **no hardcoded key count or name**. Falls back to the single current key (`OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY`) when no pool exists.
- **i18n** — Chinese / English, auto-selected from your browser language.
- **Theme-aware** — uses DSH theme tokens; works in both light and dark themes.

## How it works

**Host half** (plain Node ESM):

1. Discovers key-pool names — from `config.keyNames` if provided, otherwise by scanning `.credentials.yaml` for `OPENCODE_GO_KEY_*` entries.
2. Resolves each key value through the `credentials` service (environment → credentials file → `.env` layering).
3. Calls the official usage endpoint with `Authorization: Bearer <key>`:

```http
GET https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/usage
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

Response example:

```json
{
  "usage": {
    "rolling": { "status": "ok", "percent": 9,  "resetsAt": "2026-08-14T07:20:04.810Z" },
    "weekly":  { "status": "ok", "percent": 12, "resetsAt": "2026-08-17T00:00:00.810Z" },
    "monthly": { "status": "ok", "percent": 6,  "resetsAt": "2026-09-09T00:41:03.810Z" }
  }
}
```

> The usage endpoint is not yet part of OpenCode's public documentation; it was discovered and verified via [farion1231/cc-switch#6433](https://github.com/farion1231/cc-switch/issues/6433). Parsing is defensive.

**Client half** (browser bundle) registers in the `shell.overlay` slot and polls the Host's web-server route `/plugins/dsh-opencode-go-usage/snapshot`. **Keys never leave the Host.**

## Requirements

- Node.js + a DeepSeek Harness **web profile** (the default `dsh web` profile mounts `webServer`, `credentials`, and `timer`, which this plugin needs).

## Install

### Option A — local package via `file:` dependency (recommended)

1. Copy the package directory anywhere on disk, e.g. `D:\tools\dsh-opencode-go-usage`.
2. In your profile's `package.json` (e.g. `$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/package.json`), add to `dependencies`:

```json
"@xiaweiliang060035/dsh-opencode-go-usage": "file:D:/tools/dsh-opencode-go-usage"
```

3. Add the package to the profile's bundle list (`dsh.profile.bundles`):

```json
"dsh": {
  "profile": {
    "bundles": [ "...existing...", "dsh-opencode-go-usage" ]
  }
}
```

4. Install and restart:

```sh
cd $DSH_HOME/profiles/web
pnpm install
# restart dsh web
```

The bundle carries its own `cordis.patch.yml` (declared via `dsh.bundle.patch`), so the plugin row is composed automatically — no manual patch edit needed.

### Option B — npm package

The package is published on npm as `@xiaweiliang060035/dsh-opencode-go-usage`:

```sh
cd $DSH_HOME/profiles/web
pnpm add @xiaweiliang060035/dsh-opencode-go-usage
```

Then add `"@xiaweiliang060035/dsh-opencode-go-usage"` to the profile's `dsh.profile.bundles` list and restart `dsh web`.

> The plugin registers both a Host half (fetch + webServer route) and a Client half (browser bundle). A plain copy into `plugins/` with a relative patch entry loads the **Host half only** — the floating widget needs the bundle mechanism above.

## Configuration

Tunables go in the plugin row's `config` (override it in your profile's `cordis.patch.yml`):

```yaml
- id: opencode-go-usage
  config:
    keyNames: [go1, go2]      # optional: explicit key-pool names
    baseUrl: https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/usage   # optional
    refreshMs: 60000          # optional: poll interval (ms)
    timeoutMs: 15000          # optional: fetch timeout (ms)
    dshHome: ~                # optional: override the DSH home directory
    hideCordisPanel: true     # optional: hide the built-in "Cordis plugins" sidebar entry
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `keyNames` | auto-discovered | Explicit key-pool names (`OPENCODE_GO_KEY_<name>` in `.credentials.yaml`) |
| `baseUrl` | `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/usage` | The usage endpoint |
| `refreshMs` | `60000` | Host poll interval in milliseconds |
| `timeoutMs` | `15000` | Fetch timeout in milliseconds |
| `dshHome` | `resolveDshHome()` | DSH home directory containing `.credentials.yaml` |
| `hideCordisPanel` | `false` | Hide the built-in "Cordis plugins" sidebar entry (dynamic-plugin admin panel) |

## Key pool format

Keys are read from `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml` (the standard DSH credentials file). A pool looks like:

```yaml
OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY: sk-opencode-…      # the currently active key
OPENCODE_GO_KEY_ACTIVE: go2             # which pool entry is active
OPENCODE_GO_KEY_go1: sk-opencode-…
OPENCODE_GO_KEY_go2: sk-opencode-…
OPENCODE_GO_KEY_go3: sk-opencode-…
```

Any `OPENCODE_GO_KEY_<name>` entry is discovered automatically — **the number and names of keys are arbitrary**. If you have only one key (no pool), just set `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY`; the widget shows that single key.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
| --- | --- |
| Widget shows `!` | Snapshot fetch failed — confirm `dsh web` is running and `/plugins/dsh-opencode-go-usage/snapshot` responds |
| Card shows `Invalid key (401)` | That key is invalid or expired |
| Card shows `Network error` | Host cannot reach `opencode.ai` (proxy / offline / timeout) |
| Panel says "no keys configured" | `.credentials.yaml` has neither `OPENCODE_GO_KEY_*` nor `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY` |
| `⚠ rate-limited` | That window's quota is exhausted server-side |
