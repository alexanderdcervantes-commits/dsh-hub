# dsh-turn-rail

A Codex-style auto-hiding turn rail for DeepSeek Harness Web.

Minimal by design: no settings, no extra panels, zero runtime dependencies.

The rail lives on the right edge of the conversation. Move the pointer near the
edge and it fades in; move away and it fades out. Hover the thin zone around a
marker to preview that turn, click anywhere in the wider marker area to jump.
Long conversations keep at most 30 visible markers and scroll inside the rail,
following the current reading position.

> This project is not affiliated with DeepSeek. The interaction pattern is
> inspired by common turn-navigation rails such as Codex and the DeepSeek web
> client; the implementation is independent.

## Features

- **Edge-peek auto-hide** — appears when the pointer is within 110 px of the
  right edge, fades out 120 ms after leaving. Leaving the browser window or
  switching away follows the same fade timing.
- **Layered hit zones** — the outer zone only keeps the rail visible; the
  marker zone is clickable and highlights on hover; only the narrow detail zone
  around the marker shows the tooltip.
- **Per-turn tooltip** — one marker previews one message with time. It fades in
  and fades out with the rail, and the native browser `title` is not used.
- **Search** — the magnifier button opens a pinned search box. Type to filter
  user messages, click a result to jump. Close with `Esc`, another click on the
  button, a result click, or a click outside the rail.
- **30-marker scrolling window** — with more than 30 turns the rail scrolls
  internally with a hidden scrollbar. It pins to the newest window once when a
  session opens, then never moves itself again: the rail scroll position is
  fully user-owned.
- **Theme-aware and responsive** — markers use DSH CSS variables and scale
  slightly with viewport size.
- **Full-session projection** — the host half folds the durable session log so
  a page reload paints the complete rail without replaying history.

## Requirements

- DSH `>= 0.1.0-rc.6`
- Web profile with `sessionProjections` available (the shipped web profile has
  it)

## Install

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-turn-rail
```

Then restart `dsh web` and hard-refresh the browser tab.

### From a local checkout

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-turn-rail
```

### Remove

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-turn-rail
```

## Tuning

All tunables live at the top of `lib/client.js`:

| Constant | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EDGE_TRIGGER_PX` | `110` | Show the rail when the pointer is this close to the right edge |
| `DETAIL_LEFT_PX` / `DETAIL_RIGHT_PX` | `46` / `10` | Distance band from the right edge that opens the tooltip |
| `HIDE_DELAY_MS` | `120` | Wait before the rail starts fading out |
| `UNMOUNT_AFTER_MS` | `200` | Remove tooltip/search after the fade completes |
| `MAX_VISIBLE_MARKS` | `30` | Maximum markers visible when the rail scrolls |
| `MAX_MARK_GAP_PX` | `30` | Maximum center-to-center distance between markers when there are 30 or fewer turns |
| `SEARCH_LIMIT` | `30` | Maximum search results |

Rail geometry and marker sizes are in the `css` array in the same file.

## Model Experience

None. This is a browser UI plugin; nothing here enters a model request.
