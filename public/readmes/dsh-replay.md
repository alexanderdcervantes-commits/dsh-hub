## 😫 Sound familiar?

You kick off an agent task, come back after dinner, and:

- *"It ran for **5 hours** and burned **18M tokens** — on WHAT?"*
- *"Which tool call ate all that wall-clock time? Was it stuck?"*
- *"Did it touch my `.env`? Did it `rm -rf` anything? Who approved that?"*
- *"How much did this session actually **cost** me?"*
- *"I forked the session yesterday — where exactly did the two histories diverge?"*
- *"I want to show a teammate this hilarious failure — do they need to install the whole harness?"*

DeepSeek Harness keeps a beautiful append-only log where *everything that reached the model is reconstructible* — but ships no viewer for it. **dsh-replay is that viewer.** One plugin, and every question above becomes one click.

## ✨ What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| ⏪ **Timeline replay** | Scrub through every turn, step, message and tool call; play back at 1–16×; click any event for raw prompt/args/results/durations |
| 📊 **Overview dashboard** | Hero stats, cumulative token chart with crosshair, tool-time ranking — where the time and tokens actually went |
| 💰 **Cost estimate** | ≈ dollar cost from disjoint token accounting (cache-aware); editable pricing table, DeepSeek / Claude / OpenAI / Gemini defaults |
| 🛡️ **Security audit** | Rules-based scan: dangerous shell (`rm -rf`, `sudo`, curl-pipe…), sensitive paths (`.env`, `~/.ssh`…), sandbox/permission changes, denied approvals — ranked, clickable, extensible |
| 🌿 **Fork tree** | The whole session lineage as a clickable tree, fork boundaries labeled, subagents marked |
| ⚖️ **Compare** | Any two sessions side by side: stats, tool mix, token deltas, exact divergence seq for forks |
| 📤 **One-click HTML export** | Bake a session into a single offline `.html` — attach it to a bug report or send to a teammate; they get the full interactive replay with **zero installs** |
| 🔍 **Filter & search** | Free-text search across messages/args/results + kind filters, right in the playback bar |
| 🌏 **EN / 中文** | Whole UI switches language (findings and meta labels included); auto-detected, one-click toggle |

Dark mode follows the harness theme. Loading and empty states are hosted by **Jing Xiaoshen (鲸小深)**, our original whale-catgirl mascot (hide her with `.dshr-mascot { display: none }`).

## 🚀 Quick start

### 1️⃣ Try it first — zero install

**Online demo:** https://mingozhou.github.io/dsh-replay/ — three sample sessions, full UI, zero install.

### 2️⃣ Install into DeepSeek Harness — one npm command

The npm package ships **prebuilt**: no cloning, no building, no `allowBuilds` approval.

```sh
# released CLI (npm i -g @deepseek-ai/dsh); list your profiles with: ls ~/.dsh/profiles
dsh plugin --profile <your-profile> add @mingozhou/dsh-replay

# harness running from a source checkout (`pnpm dsh web` uses the profile named "web"):
#   run inside the harness repo directory
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add @mingozhou/dsh-replay
```

Verify with `dsh --profile <your-profile> --dump-config` (expect a `# == @mingozhou/dsh-replay` section), then restart the harness (`dsh web --profile <your-profile>` / `pnpm dsh web`) and open http://127.0.0.1:3080. You now have **two entries**:

1. the **Session Replay** button at the bottom-left of the sidebar (opens a full-screen modal with a session picker), and

2. a **Replay** tab inside every open conversation.

### 3️⃣ Install from a cloned repo (development / unreleased changes)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MingoZhou/dsh-replay.git
cd dsh-replay
npm install && npm run build      # lib/ is a build artifact — required after every fresh clone
npm run demo                      # local demo → http://localhost:4173

# then point your profile at the folder instead of npm:
dsh plugin --profile <your-profile> add <absolute-path-to>/dsh-replay
```

## 🧹 Uninstall

The official way (works **even when the harness fails to boot**, since it only runs pnpm in the profile directory):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <your-profile> remove dsh-replay        # released CLI
# or, from a harness source checkout:
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-replay
```

Then restart the harness. Manual fallback if the command itself misbehaves: open the profile directory (`~/.dsh/profiles/<your-profile>` — on Windows `C:\Users\<you>\.dsh\profiles\<your-profile>`), remove `dsh-replay` from `package.json` → `dependencies` **and** from `dsh.profile.bundles`, run `pnpm install` there, restart. Nothing else is written anywhere — the plugin keeps no state outside its own package.

## 🔧 FAQ / Troubleshooting

**`GET /replay/api/sessions` returns 404** — the config layer didn't land. The harness fails *silently* on an unresolvable plugin name: re-run the `dsh plugin add` step and check `--dump-config` for the `# == dsh-replay` section.

**`Cannot find module '…\dsh-replay\lib\index.js'` at boot** — the profile links to your plugin folder, and `lib/` is a build artifact that ships neither in git nor in release archives. Run `npm install && npm run build` inside the plugin folder (required after every fresh clone/unzip), then start the harness again.

**API works but no sidebar button / Replay tab** — the browser half didn't load. Confirm `lib/client.js` exists (run `npm run build` in the plugin), then fully restart the harness: client plugin sets are only scanned at boot, and negative results are cached.

**`EADDRINUSE: 127.0.0.1:3080`** — a previous harness instance is still running; stop it first.

**`npm install` fails on `@deepseek-ai/*` packages** — you're on an old checkout of this plugin. All harness packages are optional peers since v0.2.0; pull the latest.

**The harness updated and something broke** — the preview-phase plugin API moves. Everything hard lives in the dependency-free `core/`; fixes land in two thin adapter files. `npm run demo` always works.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
src/core      dependency-free analysis: JSONL + chunk-row decoding, timeline
              folding, audit rules, fork forest, cost model, session diff   ← 27 unit tests
src/index.ts  host half: read-only HTTP API on the harness web server
              (GET /replay/api/sessions | /session/<id> | /viewer.js)
src/client    browser half: React components + three slot registrations
              (conversation.view · sidebar.footer.action · shell.overlay)
demo/         the same components over sample logs, zero harness deps
```

The split is deliberate: a preview-phase API break means fixing an adapter, not the product. `core` is importable on its own (`dsh-replay/core`) if you want to build your own tooling over session logs — it understands the wire format including packed chunk rows, torn crash tails, seed boundaries, and compaction shadowing.

<details>
<summary><b>Wire-format notes (for fellow plugin authors)</b></summary>

`seq` is contiguous and gapless; streaming chunks may arrive packed as `text-chunks` / `reasoning-chunks` / `tool-call-chunks` rows (`seq0` + `dt[]` deltas); token usage rides `assistant/message` (and early `usage` chunks) and **replaces** rather than accumulates per turn/step; cache token counts are disjoint from `inputTokens` (billed input = input + cacheRead + cacheWrite); session titles are log-only `session/title` events — take the *last*; `session/end-seed` marks the fork/resume boundary; a final line without a newline is an uncommitted crash tail, not corruption.

</details>

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Live mode (follow a running session over the events websocket) · file-diff reconstruction from edit-tool calls · audit rule packs · replay annotations & sharing links.

Issues and PRs welcome. If you build something on `dsh-replay/core`, open a discussion — happy to link it here.
