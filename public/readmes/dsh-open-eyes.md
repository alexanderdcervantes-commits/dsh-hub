<p align="center"><strong>Let the multimodal model you choose become DeepSeek's eyes.</strong></p>

<p align="center">English · <a href="./README.zh-CN.md">中文</a></p>

## What it does

The main model used by DeepSeek Harness does not always support images. When a conversation involves a screenshot, photo, chart, or interface, `dsh-open-eyes` can send the image to a separately configured multimodal model and return its analysis as text to the current conversation.

The analysis remains part of the same conversation as ordinary text.

If the current main model already supports images, the plugin stays out of the way and DSH keeps using its native image path. Images pasted, dropped, or selected in the WebUI are bridged only when the current model is explicitly known not to support images.

The plugin also provides the `vision_analyze` tool for analyzing local image paths and explicitly enabled remote image URLs.

> **Unofficial community plugin:** `dsh-open-eyes` is an independent community project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or maintained by DeepSeek.

Three provider API formats are supported:

- OpenAI Responses
- OpenAI Chat Completions
- Anthropic Messages

Any vision service that implements one of these APIs can be connected. You choose the endpoint, model, and credentials; the plugin is not tied to a particular provider.

API keys are resolved through DSH Credential References and should never be placed in `cordis.patch.yml`, conversation text, or tool arguments. Local images are workspace-contained by default, and remote image URLs are disabled by default.

> Images handled by the bridge are sent to the third-party provider you configure. Review that provider's retention, privacy, and billing terms before use. Treat the vision model's response as evidence, not as instructions to execute.

## Usage

Requirements:

- Node.js `>=22.19.0`
- DeepSeek Harness `0.1.0-rc.6`

DSH profiles are independent. Install and configure the plugin separately in each profile where it is needed.

### Option 1: ask another harness to install it

Any harness with Shell access and permission to manage local DSH profiles can perform the installation. Prefer a harness other than the DSH instance being modified: installing or updating the active DSH profile may require a restart and interrupt the current DSH task. If the harness cannot run local commands or edit the profile, use the manual steps below instead.

Give the other harness this prompt:

```text
Install dsh-open-eyes in my local DeepSeek Harness web profile and configure
vision-bridge.

Use the DeepSeek Harness plugin command:
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-open-eyes

Use only a Credential Reference in the configuration. Do not put an API key
in YAML or in the conversation. Preserve the existing profile configuration
and do not change unrelated rows.

When finished, run:
dsh --profile web --dump-config

Confirm that vision-bridge and vision-bridge-skill are loaded, then remind me
to restart dsh web and reload the page. If changing the active profile would
interrupt this task, stop after verification and let me restart it myself.
```

### Option 2: install it yourself

Install from npm:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-open-eyes
```

You can also install the tarball attached to a GitHub Release:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-open-eyes-0.1.0.tgz
```

Catalog inclusion is not required for either command: DSH installs the published npm package directly into the selected profile. To use the tool in a headless profile, replace `web` with `headless`. Profiles remain independent.

## Configuration

Configure a vision provider in `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- id: vision-bridge
  config:
    providers:
      - id: my-vision
        protocol: openai-chat-completions
        baseUrl: https://api.example.com/v1
        model: your-vision-model
        credential: VISION_PROVIDER_API_KEY
        maxOutputTokens: 2048
        chatMaxTokensField: max_completion_tokens
    defaultProvider: my-vision
```

Store `VISION_PROVIDER_API_KEY` in the Credential source used by DSH. Keep only this reference name in the configuration file; do not put the real key there.

Available protocols:

| `protocol` | Default authentication | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openai-responses` | Bearer | OpenAI Responses API |
| `openai-chat-completions` | Bearer | Chat Completions API |
| `anthropic-messages` | `x-api-key` | `maxOutputTokens` is required |

Check the configuration:

```sh
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

After installing or updating the plugin, restart DSH Web and reload the page.

## Start using it

Paste, drop, or select an image in the WebUI, write the question you intended to ask, and send it normally.

The plugin does not add a question on your behalf or expose internal handoff instructions in the user message:

- If the current main model supports images, DSH keeps using its native image path.
- If the current main model explicitly does not support images, the configured vision provider is used.
- If no vision provider is configured, sending stops with a configuration notice and the image is not uploaded.

You can also ask DSH to call `vision_analyze` directly:

```text
Call vision_analyze on screenshots/error.png. Transcribe the exact error code
and describe the actions that are visibly available in the interface.
```

Local PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF files are supported. Relative paths are resolved from the current Agent session working directory.

Remote image URLs are disabled by default. Enable them only when needed:

```yaml
allowRemoteUrls: true
```

When enabled, the configured vision provider fetches the image URL. The plugin does not download the remote image locally first.

The example above is the minimum configuration needed for a typical provider. Keep API keys in DSH Credential storage and place only the Credential Reference name in this file.

## Permissions and data

- When the bridge is used, the selected image and prompt are sent to the configured vision provider. Review that provider's privacy, retention, and billing terms.
- Local image reads remain inside the Agent workspace and explicitly allowed roots by default. The plugin rejects final symlinks and validates supported image bytes before upload.
- Remote image URLs are disabled by default. When enabled, the provider fetches the URL; the plugin does not download it locally.
- Credentials are resolved from DSH Credential References for each call. They are not accepted in tool arguments, written to configuration, or cached by the plugin.
- The Web bridge delegates only for a route explicitly declared text-only. Image-capable and unknown routes remain on DSH's native image path.
- Retries are disabled by default. Enabling them can repeat a billable provider request after a transient failure.

## Compatibility

- DeepSeek Harness: `0.1.0-rc.6`
- Node.js: `>=22.19.0`
- Last verified: `2026-08-15`
- Verified against DeepSeek Harness commit: `47f943859bef60e4160492346772ded9b24f765a`

Web paste integration is pinned to the rc.6 conversation and model-capability seams. Recheck those seams before using the plugin with another DSH release line.

## Troubleshooting

- `VISION_NOT_CONFIGURED`: add at least one provider, set a valid default when needed, and—unless authentication is disabled—store the referenced credential in DSH.
- The package installs but the rows are absent: confirm that installation and configuration used the same profile, then run `dsh --profile web --dump-config` and look for `vision-bridge` and `vision-bridge-skill`.
- A pasted image stays on the native path: this is expected when the selected model supports images or its capability is unknown. The bridge activates only for an explicitly text-only route.
- Installation from an active DSH task is interrupted: rerun the same `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-open-eyes` command from a regular shell or another harness, verify with `--dump-config`, and restart DSH Web.
- After an update, restart DSH Web and reload the browser before diagnosing client behavior.

## Uninstall and rollback

Remove the package from the profile where it was installed:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-open-eyes
```

The command removes the package and its bundle layer. If `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml` still contains user-authored rows with the ids `vision-bridge` or `vision-bridge-skill`, remove only those rows and preserve every unrelated entry.

Verify the resulting profile:

```sh
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

The output should contain neither `vision-bridge` nor `vision-bridge-skill`. Restart DSH Web and reload the browser page afterward.

To return to the current release after testing another build, install its exact version again:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-open-eyes@0.1.0
```

## Development

The repository uses pnpm and Node.js `>=22.19.0`:

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run test
pnpm run build
npm pack --dry-run
pnpm run test:e2e
```

The E2E test packs the real npm tarball and exercises temporary-profile installation and removal without calling a paid vision API. See the [contribution guide](https://github.com/Hyp6666/dsh-open-eyes/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for repository conventions.
